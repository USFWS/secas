<h1>Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy</h1>

<p>The dramatic changes sweeping the Southeastern United States &mdash; such as urbanization, competition for water resources, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and climate change &mdash; pose unprecedented challenges for sustaining our natural and cultural resources. However, they also offer a clear opportunity to unite the conservation community around a shared, long-term vision for the future. The Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS) is that vision.</p>

<blockquote>Through SECAS, diverse partners are working together to design and achieve a connected network of lands and waters that supports thriving fish and wildlife populations and improved quality of life for people across the Southeastern United States and the Caribbean.</blockquote>

<p>Together, federal, state, nonprofit and private organizations are coordinating their conservation actions and investments to achieve a common goal: a 10% or greater improvement in the health, function, and connectivity of Southeastern ecosystems by 2060.</p>

<p>SECAS was initiated by states of the Southeastern Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies and the federal Southeast Natural Resource Leaders Group with support from Southeast and Caribbean Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) and the Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership.</p>

<p>The primary product of SECAS is the Southeast Conservation Blueprint. The Blueprint stitches together smaller subregional plans into one unifying map that identifies important areas for conservation and restoration &mdash; a living spatial plan to make the SECAS vision a reality. More than 130 people from over 50 organizations have used or are using the Blueprint in their work.</p>
