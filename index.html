<h1>Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy</h1>

<p>The dramatic changes sweeping the Southeastern United States &mdash; such as urbanization, competition for water resources, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and climate change &mdash; pose unprecedented challenges for sustaining our natural and cultural resources. However, they also offer a clear opportunity to unite the conservation community around a shared, long-term vision for the future. The Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS) is that vision. <strong><em>Through SECAS, diverse partners are working together to design and achieve a connected network of landscapes and seascapes that supports thriving fish and wildlife populations and improved quality of life for people across the Southeastern United States and the Caribbean</strong></em>. Together, federal, state, non-profit and private organizations are coordinating their conservation actions and investments to focus on common goals.</p>

<p>SECAS was initiated by states of the Southeastern Association of Fish &amp; Wildlife Agencies and the federal Southeast Natural Resource Leaders Group with support from Southeast and Caribbean Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) and the Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership.</p>
