Near-term metrics:<br>
<ul><li>1% improvement in the health, function, and connectivity of Southeastern ecosystems every 4 years</li>

<a href="../pdf/SECAS-goal-report-2023.pdf">The 2023 progress report, *Recent trends in Southeastern ecosystems*</a>, is based on the best available data from existing Southeast-wide monitoring programs since SECAS was established in 2011. Here's a snapshot from the report showing whether each indicator is on track for 1% or greater improvement every four years:

## Intended uses for goal

- **Provide a simple description of what SECAS is trying to do:** This will complement the broad SECAS vision of designing and achieving a connected network of lands and waters that supports thriving fish and wildlife populations and improved quality of life for people.
- **Attract additional sources of conservation funding to the Southeast:** A shared goal and measurement system can help communicate the need for additional funding.
- **Identify new opportunities for collaboration around shared interests:** A shared goal and understanding of Southeastern ecosystem condition can help reveal new ways to work together that may not be obvious when looking at species and ecosystems in isolation.
- **Improve connections with “non-traditional” partners:** A shared goal can help improve communication with private landowners, urban planners, forestry/agricultural interests, the Department of Defense, and other organizations shaping the lands and waters of the Southeast.

## Basis for goal numbers

The long-term goal is intended to be both ambitious and achievable. It is based on a synthesis of 13 assessments covering the Southeast (e.g., Breeding Bird Survey, National Coastal Condition Assessments, America's Longleaf Range-wide Accomplishment Reports, etc.). The near-term goals identify minimum progress needed to stay on track with meeting the long-term goal.
