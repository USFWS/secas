The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is more than just a map. It’s a living, spatial plan that identifies important areas for conservation and restoration across the Southeast and Caribbean. More than 150 people from 70 organizations have used or are using the Blueprint in their work. In the South Atlantic subregion alone, the Blueprint has helped inform more than \$21 million in conservation funding &mdash; 99% of which has supported on-the-ground conservation action.

The Blueprint stitches together smaller subregional plans into one consistent map, incorporating the best available information about the current condition of key species and habitats, as well as future threats. Because the Blueprint is a living plan, it will evolve over time, driven by improvements to the underlying science, our growing understanding of on-the-ground conditions, and input from new partners. So far, more than 1,700 people from 500 different organizations have actively participated in developing the Southeast Blueprint.

Draft Southeast Blueprint 4.0 was released in October 2019 at the annual meeting of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and is expected to be finalized soon. Significant improvements over the previous versions include: improved approaches for dealing with overlapping inputs to reduce both overprioritization and underprioritization, updates inputs from Florida and the Middle South subregion, new marine priorities around Florida, and new hubs and corridors in Florida. You can [explore and download the data on the Southeast Conservation Planning Atlas](https://seregion.databasin.org/galleries/5ada9ba2aefe4151aefba9aa877b2664) (CPA), a free online mapping platform. There, you can also read more about the methods and underlying datasets used to create Version 4.0. When Blueprint 4.0 is finalized, you'll also be able to read a user guide full of ideas about how to apply it to your own work.

### Blueprint categories

**High conservation value:** These areas are the most important for ecosystem health, function, and connectivity.  
**Medium conservation value:** This category captures areas that might require more restoration, but are important for buffering high value areas and maintaining connectivity.

### A few things to keep in mind as you explore the Blueprint

- The Blueprint identifies lands and waters that have high conservation value. A range of conservation activities could benefit those priority areas, including management, economic incentives, and protection. The Blueprint should not be interpreted as a plan for land acquisition.
- The Blueprint is not intended to be used in isolation of other datasets. Instead, it provides a regional perspective that, in combination with local data and knowledge, can help inform decisions about where to focus conservation action in the face of future change.
- If you want to find your piece of the Blueprint, depending on where you’re looking, you can explore the subregional Blueprint inputs and underlying datasets. These underlying layers can help you understand the important areas for birds, water quality, climate resilience, prescribed burning, reforestation, and much more. These other layers can help you tell the unique story of what makes your area of interest special. Contact Blueprint staff if you’d like some help.
- As a living spatial plan, the Blueprint is always a work in progress. We maintain a list of the problems with the Blueprint that have been identified in the review process so far. Those “known issues” are captured [in the Blueprint documentation on the Conservation Planning Atlas](https://seregion.databasin.org/galleries/5ada9ba2aefe4151aefba9aa877b2664). The Blueprint will continue to be refined to incorporate updates to the input layers and feedback from Blueprint users and other partners.

## The history of the Blueprint

In the fall of 2013, SECAS leadership set a goal of developing a first generation Southeast Blueprint for landscape-scale conservation by the fall of 2016. Many different conservation planning efforts were already underway, but most eco-regional plans only covered parts of states, while state-specific plans stopped at the state line. The results of all this parallel planning did not yet add up to an integrated regional strategy.

Three years later, Version 1.0 of the Southeast Blueprint was released in December 2016. Development of this first Blueprint relied heavily on Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) partnerships across the Southeast and Caribbean. This plan provided the first ever integration of spatial plans developed through the South Atlantic, Appalachian, Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks, Gulf Coast Prairie, North Atlantic, and Caribbean LCCs.

Version 2.0 of the Southeast Blueprint was released in November 2017. This plan incorporated the improved subregional Blueprints from several LCCs and established priority connections with western states through the Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool. Significant improvements over Version 1.0 included improved consistency across LCC boundaries, improved consistency in climate change response, and improved integration beyond the Southeast.

Version 3.0 of the Southeast Blueprint was first introduced at the October 2018 SEAFWA annual meeting, and officially released in February 2019. Its development occurred during a time of transition for the LCC Network where the structure and function of some LCCs was changing. Despite these changes, the capacity and commitment to continue to support Blueprint users and improve the Southeast Blueprint remains strong, evidenced by the many examples of Blueprint implementation, as well as progress on Blueprint improvements. Blueprint 3.0 added full coverage of Texas, integrated threat layers covering the full Southeast, and a hubs and corridors layer covering part of the region. 

Draft Version 4.0 of the Southeast Blueprint was released in October 2019 at the SEAFWA annual meeting. Improvements over the previous version include: improved approaches for dealing with overlapping inputs to reduce both overprioritization and underprioritization, updates inputs from Florida and the Middle South subregion, new marine priorities around Florida, and new hubs and corridors in Florida.

The next version of the Southeast Blueprint is expected in Fall 2020. It continues the ongoing evolution toward better integration across the various Blueprint inputs and regular updates based on the best available information.
