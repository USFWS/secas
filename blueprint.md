>The SECAS vision: a connected network of landscapes and seascapes that supports thriving fish and wildlife populations and improved quality of life for people.

The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is more than just a map. It’s a living, spatial plan that identifies shared conservation and restoration priorities across the Southeast and Caribbean. Just as a construction blueprint serves as a plan for achieving an architect’s design for a building, the Conservation Blueprint serves as a plan for achieving the SECAS vision. More than 130 people from over 50 organizations have used or are using the Blueprint in their work. In the South Atlantic subregion alone, the Blueprint has helped inform more than $20 million in conservation funding &mdash; 99% of which has supported on-the-ground conservation action.

By providing regional context for local decisions, the Blueprint helps organizations with different goals find common ground &mdash; opportunities to align their efforts to protect fish and wildlife habitat, improve quality of life for people, safeguard life and property, and develop strong economies. As the Blueprint guides decisions and brings in new resources to benefit our communities, our livelihoods, and our natural and cultural heritage, it is shaping a more sustainable future for our region.

Hundreds of people representing a diverse range of organizations have actively participated in developing the Southeast Blueprint so far. The Blueprint stitches together smaller subregional plans into one consistent map, incorporating the best available information about the current condition of key species and habitats, as well as future threats. Because the Blueprint is a living plan, these spatial priorities will evolve over time, driven by improvements to the underlying science, our growing understanding of on-the-ground conditions, and input from new partners.

## Who’s using the Blueprint

**Specific examples of how the Blueprint has been used include:**

- A regional Council of Government used the Blueprint to help a town refine the natural habitat cores in their comprehensive plan.
- A National Wildlife Refuge Manager used the Blueprint to support a proposal for funding to help recover an endangered salamander.
- A private company used the Blueprint in a confidential analysis to support its business.
- A state wildlife agency used the Blueprint to support a proposal for funding to protect coastal wetlands and improve public access to recreation opportunities.
- Longleaf pine conservation partnerships used the Blueprint to identify restoration and management priorities.
- A nonprofit organization used the Blueprint to support a critical source of conservation funding at its state legislature.
- A National Forest used the Blueprint to inform its public lands planning.

These are just a few of almost 50 Blueprint uses completed so far, with about 60 more still in progress! For more in-depth examples of how the Blueprint is being used, check out the [SECAS in Action story map]({{ "/story-map" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

## Blueprint Version 2.0

[Southeast Blueprint 2.0 was](https://seregion.databasin.org/datasets/4693633d66ac4c83a5724f83353a2f76) released in November 2017. Significant improvements over Version 1.0 include improved consistency across LCC boundaries, improved consistency in climate change response, and improved integration beyond the Southeast. You can [explore and download the Blueprint data on the Southeast Conservation Planning Atlas](https://seregion.databasin.org/datasets/4693633d66ac4c83a5724f83353a2f76) (CPA), a free online mapping platform. There, you can also read more the underlying datasets and methods used to create Version 2.0.

[Southeast Blueprint Version 2.0](https://seregion.databasin.org/datasets/4693633d66ac4c83a5724f83353a2f76) identifies high value areas for conservation and restoration across the Southeast and Caribbean. Protected areas are shown for context.

A few things to keep in mind as you explore the Blueprint:

- The Blueprint identifies lands and waters that have high conservation value. A range of conservation activities could benefit those priority areas, including management, economic incentives, and protection. The Blueprint should not be interpreted as a plan for land acquisition.
- The Blueprint is not intended to be used in isolation of other datasets. Instead, it provides a regional perspective that, in combination with local data and knowledge, can help inform decisions about where to focus conservation action in the face of future change.
- If you want to find your piece of the Blueprint, depending on where you’re looking, you can explore the subregional Blueprint inputs and underlying datasets that drive the Blueprint priorities. These underlying layers can help you understand the priorities for birds, water quality, climate resilience, prescribed burning, reforestation, and much more. These other layers can help you tell the unique story of what makes your area of interest special. Contact Blueprint staff if you’d like some help.
- The high conservation value areas are the most important for ecosystem health, function, and connectivity. Medium captures areas that might require more restoration, but are important for buffering those high value areas and maintaining connectivity.
- As a living spatial plan, the Blueprint is always a work in progress. We maintain a list of the problems with the Blueprint that have been identified in the review process so far. Those “known issues” are captured [in the Blueprint documentation on the Conservation Planning Atlas](https://seregion.databasin.org/datasets/4693633d66ac4c83a5724f83353a2f76). The Blueprint will continue to be refined to incorporate updates to the input layers and feedback from Blueprint users and other partners.

## The history of the Blueprint

In the fall of 2013, SECAS leadership set a goal of developing a first generation Southeast Blueprint for landscape-scale conservation by the fall of 2016. Many different conservation planning efforts were already underway, but most eco-regional plans only covered parts of states, while state-specific plans stopped at the state line. The results of all this parallel planning did not yet add up to an integrated regional strategy.

Three years later, Version 1.0 of the Southeast Blueprint was released in December 2016. Development of this first Blueprint relied heavily on Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) partnerships across the Southeast and Caribbean. This plan provided the first ever integration of spatial priorities identified through the South Atlantic, Appalachian, Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks, Gulf Coast Prairie, North Atlantic, and Caribbean LCCs.

Version 2.0 of the Southeast Blueprint was released in November 2017. This plan incorporated the improved subregional Blueprints from several LCCs and established priority connections with western states through the Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool. Significant improvements over Version 1.0 included improved consistency across LCC boundaries, improved consistency in climate change response, and improved integration beyond the Southeast.

Version 3.0 of the Southeast Blueprint is expected in Fall 2018. Its development has occurred during a time of transition for the LCC Network, when the structure and function of some LCCs are changing. Despite these changes, the capacity and commitment to continue to support Blueprint users and improve the Southeast Blueprint remains strong. Significant improvements over the previous versions will include: full coverage of Texas, integrated threat layers covering the full Southeast, and the addition of a hubs and corridors layer covering most of the region.

## Blueprint Map 2.0

SECAS Blueprint 2.0 was presented in October during the 2017 Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ annual meeting in Louisville, Kentucky.  Significant improvements over version 1.0 include improved consistency across LCC boundaries, improved consistency in climate change response, and improved integration beyond the Southeast.

Here are several notes to consider when looking at the map:

  - The Blueprint represents lands with high conservation value; it does not represent an acquisition boundary.
  - There are many potential conservation layers embedded within the Blueprint map such as prescribed burning and reforestation. When separated out, a much smaller subset of the Blueprint map is relevant.
  - The “medium” scoring areas are important for promoting and maintaining connectivity.
  - The Blueprint is being refined as this collaborative partnership work moves forward and significant efforts are already underway across the region.

## How Can the Blueprint be Used?

The Blueprint can be used by local governments, transportation planners, developers, private businesses, federal and state agencies, nonprofits, and many other groups to help answer challenging questions, such as:

- What are the most crucial areas to conserve today for species of greatest conservation need, proactively reducing the need for future protection?
- Where are the best places for smart urban growth that minimize negative impacts to fish and wildlife, conserve clean and plentiful drinking water, and provide greater access to open space?
- How does public and private land conservation contribute to a connected network of lands and waters across the region?
- Where would stream restoration provide the most benefits to fish, human health, and outdoor recreation?
- Where should we focus conservation efforts now to improve the resilience of ecosystems and communities in advance of major disasters like hurricanes and oil spills?
- Where will economic incentives achieve the most conservation benefits on working lands?
