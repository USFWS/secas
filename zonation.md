###**Zonation** Spatial Priority Ranking for Conservation and Land-Use Planning  
_Developed by the Conservation Biology Informatics Group (C-BIG) at the University of Helsinki Department of Biosciences_

Zonation is a conservation planning framework and software. It produces a hierarchical prioritization of the landscape based on the occurrence levels of biodiversity features in sites (cells) by iteratively removing the least valuable remaining cell while accounting for connectivity and generalized complementarity. The output of Zonation can be imported into GIS software to create maps or for further analysis. Zonation v. 4.0 can process very large data sets containing up to ~50 million grid cells with effective data.

Zonation identifies areas important for retaining habitat quality and connectivity for multiple species, indirectly aiming at speciesâ€™ long-term persistence. The computational strategy of Zonation can be characterized as maximal retention of weighted, range size normalized (rarity corrected) richness. Zonation produces a complementarity-based priority ranking.
