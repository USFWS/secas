Two Requests for Proposals from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation are now open with applications due in early April: the [National Coastal Resilience Fund](https://www.nfwf.org/programs/national-coastal-resilience-fund/national-coastal-resilience-fund-2024-request-proposals) (NRCF) and the [America the Beautiful Challenge](https://www.nfwf.org/programs/america-beautiful-challenge/americas-ecosystem-restoration-initiative-america-beautiful-challenge-2024-request-proposals) (ATBC).<!--more--> 

The focus of the NCRF is enhancing resilience for coastal communities, with particular emphasis on nature-based solutions and community engagement. Proposals are due April 10th.

The focus of the ATBC is broadly conserving, connecting, and restoring lands, waters, and wildlife, with particular emphasis on locally led landscape-scale conservation. Pre-proposals are due April 4th.

Would you like help strengthening your proposal to one of these (or other) grant programs? **Blueprint user support staff can assist by communicating how your project contributes to regional goals and strategies, making maps, analyzing the alignment with the Blueprint and underlying datasets, assessing risk of urbanization or sea-level rise,  writing letters of support, and more.** Over the past two years of the ATBC, user support staff helped support 27 proposals, 9 of which were successfully funded to the tune of almost $25 million. 

We'd love to help you get your important conservation work accomplished! You can find contact information for members of the user support team on the [SECAS staff page](https://secassoutheast.org/staff).
