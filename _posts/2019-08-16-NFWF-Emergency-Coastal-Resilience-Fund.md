The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) is hosting a webinar next month about their new Emergency Coastal Resilience Fund.  It aims to increase the resilience of coastal communities within federally declared counties impacted by hurricanes Florence and Michael and wildfires in 2018 (as well as Typhoon Yutu, but that’s not as relevant to the South Atlantic region). On the webinar you can learn about the funding opportunity and how to submit a competitive grant proposal.<!--more-->

**Webinar date/time:** Sept. 4, 1 – 2 p.m. ET

**Register:** [bit.ly/2T7IrPS](bit.ly/2T7IrPS)

**The RFP is available here and will close November 12th:** [https://www.nfwf.org/coastalresilience/emergency/Pages/home.aspx](https://www.nfwf.org/coastalresilience/emergency/Pages/home.aspx)

Your user support staff would love to help you use the Blueprint to strengthen your proposal if you’d like to go after this funding! Whether you’re in the South Atlantic or elsewhere in the Southeast, user support is available and totally free.
