Ever wonder how SECAS is organized, who the partners are, or how the information flows? To help answer some of these questions, SECAS developed [a one-page factsheet](http://secassoutheast.org/pdf/SECAS_Org_Structure_2021.pdf) detailing the organizational structure of the SECAS partnership, including descriptions and roles of the executive steering committee, SECAS staff, and designated Points of Contact.

The factsheet outlines recent changes to the organizational structure resulting from establishment of SECAS as a standing committee of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA). The changes also reflect recommendations from a comprehensive evaluation of SECAS completed in 2020 known as [the SECAS Futures Project](http://secassoutheast.org/pdf/SECAS_Futures_final_report_March_2021.pdf). The new organizational fact sheet provides an explanation of structural detail that complements the [SECAS Statement of Purpose](http://secassoutheast.org/pdf/SECAS_final_Purpose_Statement_approved_5-24-2021.pdf), a description of SECASâ€™ vision, function, and guiding principles officially adopted by the steering committee in May.
