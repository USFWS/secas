Across the Southeast, we hear that grassland and savanna ecosystems are declining. But how do you measure their decline? 

Are you interested in discussing recent trends in grasslands and savannas? Want to provide some feedback on methods and estimates of change over the last 10+ years? Do you have an hour to join a virtual meeting? If so, sign up for one of the upcoming virtual meetings!

As part of the 2024 progress report on the [SECAS goal](https://secassoutheast.org/our-goal), there will be a new indicator measuring trends in the extent and condition of grasslands and savannas. You might remember that there’s going to be [a new grassland and savannas indicator in the Blueprint this year](https://secassoutheast.org/2024/03/26/The-plan-for-the-2024-Southeast-Conservation-Blueprint.html). The plan is to use those ideas to look at trends over time as well. That’s where we need your help.<!--more-->

On the call we’ll walk you through the methods, share results so far, and get your thoughts on the approach and the results.
