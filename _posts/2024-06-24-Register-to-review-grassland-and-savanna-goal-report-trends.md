Are you interested in recent trends in grasslands and savannas? Want to provide some feedback on methods and estimates of recent change? Do you have an hour to join a virtual meeting? If so, please sign up for one of the upcoming virtual meetings. 

As part of the 2024 progress report on the SECAS goal, there will be a new indicator for grasslands and savannas. You might remember that there’s going to be a new grassland and savannas indicator in the Blueprint this year. The plan is to use those ideas to look at trends over time as well. That’s where we need your help. 

On the call we’ll walk you through the methods, share results so far, and get your thoughts on the approach and the results.
