As you may have already seen, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) has released its [request for pre-proposals for the 2023 America the Beautiful Challenge (ATBC)](https://www.nfwf.org/programs/america-beautiful-challenge/america-beautiful-challenge-2023-request-proposals). This year, NFWF has added a pre-proposal stage (with a 3-page limit for the project narrative). Pre-proposals are due on Thursday April 20, 2023.

According to the RFP, "The ATBC vision is to streamline grant funding opportunities for new voluntary conservation and restoration projects around the United States. This RFP consolidates funding from multiple federal agencies and the private sector to enable applicants to conceive and develop large-scale, locally led projects that address shared funder priorities spanning public and private lands. In year two of the ATBC approximately $116 million will be awarded in nationwide funding to conserve, connect and restore the lands, waters, and wildlife upon which we all depend."<!--more-->

This year, the RFP focuses on five project themes:

- Conserving and restoring rivers, coasts, wetlands and watersheds
- Conserving and restoring forests, grasslands and important ecosystems that serve as carbon sinks
- Connecting and reconnecting wildlife corridors, large landscapes, watersheds, and seascapes
- Improving ecosystem and community resilience to flooding, drought, and other climate-related threats
- Expanding access to the outdoors, particularly in underserved communities

Are you thinking of applying? The ATBC has a national scope and provides several funding pathways ranging from grants focused on implementation, planning, Sentinel Landscapes, National Forests, and private forests, rangeland, and farmland. State agencies, U.S. territories, and Tribes are eligible to apply for all five grant categories, while nonprofit organizations, local governments, municipal governments, and educational institutions can apply in three of them.

Your Southeast Blueprint user support staff would love to help you tell a compelling story about how your project would contribute to a regional goal and vision. Last year, the user support team assisted with 13 America the Beautiful Challenge Proposals (3 of which got funded). We can analyze data, make maps, and write narratives that help meet the priorities of the RFP around nature-based solutions, community resilience benefits, and fish and wildlife benefits. Would you like to look at:

- How your project area scores in the Southeast Conservation Blueprint?
- How your proposed actions would contribute to regional connectivity and help create wildlife corridors that link terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems?
- What potential project areas would be most resilient to sea-level rise and other impacts of climate change?
- How your project would advance [the SECAS Goal](https://secassoutheast.org/our-goal) of a 10% or greater improvement in ecosystem health, function, and connectivity by 2060?
- Where new outdoor recreation opportunities would most benefit socially vulnerable communities?
- Where grassland, forest, and riparian restoration projects would produce the biggest natural and cultural resource co-benefits?

User support can help by contributing to your pre-proposal, writing a letter of support, or just brainstorming creative ways to connect local actions to regional impacts. You can find our contact information [on the SECAS staff page](https://secassoutheast.org/staff).

Here are the upcoming key dates and deadlines.
