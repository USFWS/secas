More and more people seem to be talking about Piedmont prairies lately. It’s another ecosystem that has gone through huge declines, but is starting to come back—thanks to the work of many dedicated people throughout the Piedmont. With all the interest in pollinators, history, and greenspace, it’s also great way to connect with the growing urban communities of the Piedmont.

It should be no surprise that preserving, restoring, and recreating these prairies is also an important part of the [South Atlantic Blueprint Implementation Strategy](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/file/get/59fb6c57e4b0531197b1684d?name=BlueprintImplementationStrategy.pdf), which guides implementation of one of the inputs to the Southeast Blueprint. Just like with longleaf, there’s a real opportunity to connect public and private organizations to make some big change.
