The 2022 [Southeast Conservation Blueprint](https://secassoutheast.org/blueprint) now covers almost all of the Southeast with consistent methods and indicators. What's next for 2023? 

The plan is to focus on extending those consistent methods to the places we couldn't quite get to this year. That includes Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and additional marine areas in places like the Gulf of Mexico and parts of the Atlantic. Lots of folks have been asking for the consistent Blueprint methods to include those areas. Making that happen is going to be a major focus for 2023.
