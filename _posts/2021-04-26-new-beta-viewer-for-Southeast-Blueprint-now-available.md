A beta version of an online viewer for the Southeast Blueprint is finally ready for public release! This viewer is designed to let you easily explore the Southeast Blueprint and learn about the underlying data.

You can [access the beta viewer here](https://blueprint.geoplatform.gov/southeast/). It's linked from the Blueprint and Resources pages of the SECAS website. Here are some of the things you can do with this beta viewer!

- Upload a shapefile for your area of interest to generate a detailed pdf report with custom maps and analysis of the Blueprint, underlying plans, indicator datasets, threats, and protected lands information.
- Select a HUC12 subwatershed or marine lease block to learn how the Blueprint is scoring and what subregional plan(s) the Blueprint is based on in that area. In some subregions (Florida, South Atlantic, and Nature's Network), you can also go one layer deeper and dig into the underlying indicators that are driving those priorities. In addition, the viewer will show the projected impacts of urbanization and/or sea-level rise on a particular HUC12, as well as the conserved status and ownership of protected lands.<!--more-->
- Export a pdf summary report for a selected HUC12 subwatershed or lease block, which contains comparable information to the custom report, but does not require uploading a shapefile.
- Turn the Blueprint layer on and off using the eye symbol in the legend, and switch the basemap using the circle in the bottom left of the map. This is intended to help folks orient more easily.
- Use the find a location feature on the left-hand sidebar to automatically navigate to many common places and landmarks.
- Contact user support if you'd like help using the Blueprint or understanding how it works.
- Access the main functionality from your phone or tablet!

The viewer is considered a beta version because it doesn't yet include the full suite of planned features. We want to add underlying indicator data for more of the underlying Blueprint plans, and the improved consistency of the upcoming major revision to the 2022 Blueprint will make that much more feasible. We'd like to incorporate hubs and connectors information from the Blueprint into the viewer and reporting to highlight areas important for connectivity. And, we'd like to add a "pixel mode" feature that allows a user to drill into each underlying pixel of the Blueprint, the smallest possible unit of the prioritization, to see exactly how it scores in the underlying data.

As part of our commitment to tailoring our plans and tools to user needs, the current beta viewer has undergone testing with several Blueprint users who generously volunteered their time. This helped enormously in fixing some early problems and confusing features. But, as always, it's still a work in progress. If you have a suggestion on how to improve the viewer, feel free to reach out to hilary_morris@fws.gov. Your feedback would be very helpful as we move into the next phase of refining the beta viewer and adding additional features!

If you'd like a more in-depth tutorial on how to use the beta viewer, you can watch [a recording of the March 18th webinar where Louise and I gave a live demonstration of an earlier iteration of the beta viewer](https://youtu.be/qaqjLXGDmbs). If you look closely, you might notice some of the things we changed in response to user testing feedback!
