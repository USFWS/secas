The [2019 Gulf Coast Land Conservation Conference](http://gulfpartnership.org/2019-annual-gulf-coast-land-conservation-conference/) is coming up this September 9-11 in Point Clear, Alabama. This conference is hosted by the Partnersihp for Gulf Coast Land Conservation. It provides an opportunity to find new strategies for funding the conservation, new partners, and new science and mapping tools for setting conservation priorities.

The Southeast Blueprint is one of the mapping tools that will be showcased at a Tools Cafe session during the conference. You don't want to miss the chance to talk to Blair Tirpak with U.S. Geological Survey, part of the SECAS staff team! As our resident expert on the Gulf Coast Prairie Blueprint, one of the inputs to the Southeast Blueprint, she's the user support lead for Oklahoma and Texas. Blair can show you how to view, download, and understand the Southeast Blueprint so you can use it to strengthen your proposals and inform your decisions!
