The All Hands meeting for the Gulf of Mexico Alliance is coming up next week in Gulf Shores, AL. The Southeast Blueprint is one of the mapping tools that will be showcased at a Tools Cafe session during the conference. The Tools Cafe is scheduled for Monday, June 10 from 5:30-8:30 PM. You don’t want to miss the chance to talk to Blair Tirpak with U.S. Geological Survey, part of the SECAS staff team! As our resident expert on the Gulf Coast Prairie Blueprint, one of the inputs to the Southeast Blueprint, she’s the user support lead for Oklahoma and Texas. Blair can show you how to view, download, and understand the Southeast Blueprint so you can use it to strengthen your proposals and inform your decisions!

As another Gulf of Mexico event of interest, the 2019 Gulf Coast Land Conservation Conference is also coming up this September 9-11 in Point Clear, Alabama. This conference, organized around the theme "New tools for coastal conservation in a changing world," is hosted by the Partnership for Gulf Coast Land Conservation. It provides a great opportunity to find new conservation funding strategies, new partners, and new science and mapping tools for setting conservation priorities.
