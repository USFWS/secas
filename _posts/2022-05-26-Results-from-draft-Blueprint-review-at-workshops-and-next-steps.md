Thanks so much to all the folks who came to the recent Blueprint 2022 workshops. All the great feedback is going to greatly improve this and future versions of the Blueprint. If you want to learn more about who came, check out Hilary's blog.

We got more than 400 spatial comments on the draft version of Southeast Conservation Blueprint 2022. Some were questions, some were underprioritized areas, and others were places that looked good. Those comments, and others in the workshop chat, are guiding what improvements we work on for the Blueprint. We're hoping to be able to incorporate some of those improvement before finalizing this version of the Blueprint later this year. For things we can't fix, we'll document them in the known issues and prioritize them for improvements in next year's Blueprint.<!--more-->

What improvements are we working on based on workshop feedback? Here's a taste of a few we're hoping to get into this year's Blueprint. This is based both on the workshop comments and the ease of making the update with currently available data. No promises on any of these, but I wanted to give you a sense of things we're trying.

Improve prioritization of: 
- grasslands (including open forests)
- working lands in Florida
- playas
- restoration opportunities in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley
- deep-sea coral and hardbottom
- small islands
- important areas for bats and salamanders (especially in the Appalachians)
- important areas for brook trout
- important areas for lesser prairie chickens

We also scoped out a number of other improvements that will take longer to fix than we have for this Blueprint cycle. We'll be prioritizing those for next year.
