Join the conversation on **June 17th @ 10 am Eastern time** to talk about many interesting issues related to corridors in the 2022 Southeast Blueprint.

Next month's South Atlantic Third Thursday Web Forum will discuss some options and ideas for corridors to inform the 2021 version of the South Atlantic Blueprint (which will serve as an input to the 2021 Southeast Blueprint, coming this fall). Even if you don't work in the South Atlantic region, you're welcome to participate if you want to get a head start talking about some issues that will also be important for [next year's larger Southeast Blueprint update using consistent methods and indicators across 12 states](http://secassoutheast.org/2021/03/12/New-approach-to-Southeast-Blueprint-in-2022.html).<!--more-->
