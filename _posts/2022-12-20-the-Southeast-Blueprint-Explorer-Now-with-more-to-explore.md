[In my blog last month](https://secassoutheast.org/2022/11/15/Southeast-Blueprint-Explorer-updated-with-2022-data.html), I previewed some of the new features of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint Explorer viewer that were already available, and those that were coming soon. We're happy to announce one of those shiny new functions is now available: pixel mode!

When you first visit the Blueprint Explorer, you'll still start in the familiar "summary data" mode by default, which allows you to select 12-digit HUC subwatersheds in the inland environment, and outer contentinal shelf lease blocks in the marine environment. Now, there's a new toggle at the top that allows you to switch to "pixel data".

When you click on "pixel data", a bulls-eye will appear in the middle of the map. The panel on the left-hand side will then tell you about the Blueprint priorities, hubs and corridors, and indicators that occur in the pixel in the center of that bulls-eye. You can then use your cursor (the hand) to pan the map around to move a different area underneath the bulls-eye. This allows you to see exactly why a specific area has been prioritized in the Blueprint. This so helpful, even to us staff members who are pretty familiar with the Blueprint already. In the past we had to pull up a desktop GIS system (like ArcGIS) in order to do this. Now we can quickly explore the Blueprint in the Simple Viewer and all we need is an internet connection!
