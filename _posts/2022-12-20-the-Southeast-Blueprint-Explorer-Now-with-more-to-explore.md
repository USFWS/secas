    The new pixel mode within the Southeast Blueprint Explorer allows you to drill into a single pixel to learn how it scores in the underlying Blueprint data. This pixel within Great Smoky Mountains National Park scores highly on the intact habitat cores and resilient terrestrial sites indicators.

[In my blog last month](https://secassoutheast.org/2022/11/15/Southeast-Blueprint-Explorer-updated-with-2022-data.html), I highlighted the new features of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint Explorer viewer that were already available, and previewed a few more that were coming soon. One of those new functions is now available: pixel mode! Pixel mode allows you to discover what's driving the Blueprint priorities within the smallest unit of the analysis, a 30 m x 30 m pixel.

When you first visit the Blueprint Explorer, you'll still start in the familiar "summary data" mode by default, which allows you to select a 12-digit HUC subwatershed in the inland environment or outer contentinal shelf lease blocks in the marine environment and view summarized Blueprint information for that area. Now, there's a new toggle at the top that allows you to switch to "pixel data".<!--more-->

When you click on "pixel data", a bulls-eye will appear in the middle of the map. The left-hand sidebar will tell you about the Blueprint priorities, hubs and corridors, indicators, threats, and more that occur in the pixel in the center of that bulls-eye. You can then use your cursor (the hand) to pan the map behind the bulls-eye and identify different pixels. This allows you to see exactly why a specific area has been prioritized in the Blueprint. 

Even for staff members who are already very familiar with the Blueprint, pixel mode can be super helpful. In the past, we had to pull up the individual layers for each dataset to see how a particular pixel scored in the Blueprint, indicators, and connectivity analysis. Now we can more quickly explore the Blueprint priorities in this easy-to-use online viewer!
