You might remember [my post back in August](https://secassoutheast.org/2018/08/07/updated-story-map-for-the-southeast-conservation-adaptation-strategy.html) covering an update to the [“SECAS in Action” story map](http://secassoutheast.org/story-map). I’m happy to say the rest of the website wasn’t far behind!

The website keeps the same look and feel. We’ve just refreshed the content to reflect the most current information about SECAS, the Southeast Blueprint, how to get involved, and more. We’ve listed the user support lead for each state in the Southeast, so everyone across the region knows who to talk to if they’d like help using the Blueprint. And you can see a list of the organizations who have already used, or are in the process of using, the Blueprint!<!--more-->

Expect some more changes in a few months after the SEAFWA Annual Meeting, when the SEAFWA Directors will review [a draft overarching goal for SECAS](https://secassoutheast.org/2018/08/06/the-state-of-southeastern-ecosystems.html) and the [latest version of the Southeast Blueprint](https://secassoutheast.org/2018/07/06/coming-this-fall-in-the-secas-update.html).

Check it out at secassoutheast.org, and let me know what you think!
