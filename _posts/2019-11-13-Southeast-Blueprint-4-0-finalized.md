Southeast Blueprint Version 4.0 is now finalized! It was presented and reviewed at the Southeast Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA) annual meeting a couple of weeks ago. Since no one raised any concerns or caught any mistakes, it’s officially ready to use.<!--more-->

We made lots of great improvements this year, including:

- Fixed the overprioritization in Texas, Oklahoma, and the mountains of West Virginia and Virginia 
- Improved priorities in the Lower Mississippi Valley, Louisiana marshes, and the Southern Appalachians 
- Updated inputs from Florida and the Middle South 
- Expanded marine coverage to fully include state and federal waters around Florida 
- Hubs and corridors layer now includes all of Florida
