Next month's South Atlantic Third Thursday Web Forum will focus on Zonation, the modeling software program used to create the South Atlantic Blueprint, one input to the Southeast Blueprint. Rua has already blogged about [the new approach planned for the Southeast Blueprint in 2022](http://secassoutheast.org/2021/03/12/New-approach-to-Southeast-Blueprint-in-2022.html). Starting next year, we’ll start using Zonation to prioritize a larger swath of the Southeast using a consistent suite of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine indicators. This approach draws on data, best practices, and lessons learned from the South Atlantic Blueprint, Appalachian NatureScape Design, and Middle Southeast Blueprint, as well as the Oklahoma and Texas CHAT and Gulf Hypoxia Blueprint. This webinar presents a great opportunity to learn more about the technical details of the modeling approach for Southeast Blueprint 2022–how the algorithm prioritizes, how indicators are weighed, and more. There will be plenty of time to discuss and ask questions.<!--more-->

A recording will be posted afterwards [to the calendar event on the South Atlantic website](https://www.southatlanticlcc.org/event/spatial-conservation-planning-with-zonation/), if you’re unable to make the webinar.
