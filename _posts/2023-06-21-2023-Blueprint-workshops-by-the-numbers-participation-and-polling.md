Last month, we wrapped up 2 exciting weeks of virtual workshops to review draft Southeast Blueprint 2023 in the U.S. Caribbean and the offshore Atlantic and Gulf marine environment. Thanks so much to the 91 people from 45 organizations who participated! Especially given the more narrow geographic focus of this year's workshops (compared to last year's, which covered all 15 Southeast states), we had a great turnout. The chart above shows how attendance broke down by sector.

As usual, the primary focus of the workshops was getting spatially explicit feedback on the Blueprint priorities. If you want to learn more about what we heard and how we're working to incorporate those suggestions into the final Blueprint, >>visit Rua's blog. When we bring together such a wide swath of the conservation community, we also like to take full advantage of the opportunity to get feedback on other things, as well. This year, we asked for recommendations on how best to refer to different parts of the Blueprint and how best to structure the data download package.

Now that we've extended consistent methods and indicators to the U.S. Caribbean, we're realizing we need a short and sweet way to distinguish between "the portion of the Blueprint that covers Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the surrounding marine environment" and "the portion of the Blueprint that covers 15 Southeast states and surrounding federal waters". Because, goodness knows, what I just wrote is way too long! "Caribbean Blueprint" seems to be working fairly well as a shorthand for the first section. But for the first second, we were having trouble choosing between a number of options--mainland Southeast? Contiguous Southeast? Continental Southeast?






The primary focus of the workshop was gathering spatially explicit comments on where the Blueprint is underprioritizing, overprioritizing, or correctly prioritizing important areas for conservation. If you want to learn more about the spatial feedback provided by workshop attendees, and the fixes we’re hoping to implement this year based on that input, check out Rua’s blog.
Here I’m going to focus on another element of the workshop–collecting feedback on the wording we use to communicate the Blueprint. You’ve probably seen this map of the current Blueprint before:

A map depicting key high value areas for conservation and restoration to achieve the SECAS goal. Map includes high and medium ranked areas from the Blueprint.
Southeast Conservation Blueprint Version 2021.
It uses the words high and medium “conservation value” to characterize the most important places for conservation and restoration across the region. This wording represented a compromise across the science coordinators leading the development of all the various subregional inputs to the current Southeast Blueprint.

This year, as we transition to a more consistent approach using standardized methods and data across most of the Southeast, we had an opportunity to reevaluate how we describe the Blueprint priority classes. So, we polled a suite of Blueprint users, science communicators, and Blueprint staff to get their reactions to that phrase, “conservation value.” It became immediately clear that the term “value” means very different things to different people. To some, it evoked the idea of intrinsic worth. To others, it brought to mind an objective score or rating. Still others thought of economic value, which had negative connotations for some folks.

So, we came up with and tested a few alternatives that tied back to the SECAS vision of “a connected network of lands and waters that supports thriving fish and wildlife populations and improved quality of life for people.” The two frontrunners as we went into workshops were “priority for a connected network of lands and waters” and “importance for a connected network of lands and waters.” At the workshops, we asked all attendees to vote for the wording that they felt was the most clear and compelling.

Here are the results:

Pie chart showing the breakdown of Blueprint wording poll results (Priority - 77%, Importance - 23%).
Across all 16 workshops, "Priority for a connected network of lands and waters" won out as best wording for the Blueprint classes.
As you can see, “priority” was the most popular choice by a significant margin. So that’s what we’ll be using for this year’s Blueprint update (and beyond)! The resulting Blueprint map released this fall should look something like this:
