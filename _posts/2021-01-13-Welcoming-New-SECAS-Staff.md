Biologist Chris DeVore is joining the Blueprint user support team after starting his career with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in the Northeast. He started with the Serviceâ€™s Chesapeake Bay Field Office in the Coastal Program and more recently worked in the Maine Field Office in the Endangered Species Program. Since June 2020, Chris has worked with Southeast Blueprint user support, based out of Cookeville, TN. His work focuses on connecting with regional partners to implement and improve the Blueprint in the southern Appalachians (KY, TN) and Middle Southeast (primarily MS, AL). He moved to Tennessee with his wife Katie and their lab/shepherd mix Maple, and they welcomed a new daughter Camden in October 2020. They are excited to continue exploring their new home state well into 2021.

Emily Granstaff is based out of Cookeville, TN and has been with the USFWS since 2009. During her career with the Service, she provided science and GIS support for landscape-scale, aquatic habitat initiatives in conjunction with the Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership. She also worked in the Tennessee Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program to implement habitat restoration projects with private landowners that benefit federally listed species. Like others on the Blueprint User Support team, she currently provides science and networking support to conservation partners and USFWS programs interested in aligning their conservation actions with the Southeast Blueprint. She focuses primarily in the Southern Appalachian subregion and is the point of contact for partners in Tennessee and Kentucky. Emily is a native Tennessean and enjoys finding hidden fishing spots with her husband and their two sons across the Southeast.
