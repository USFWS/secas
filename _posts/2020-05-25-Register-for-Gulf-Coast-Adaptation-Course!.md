**Biweekly webinar sessions beginning in June**  
This interactive, web-based course is designed for conservation professionals committed to better integrating adaptation fundamentals into their work on the front lines of climate change, the United States Gulf Coast. Expert speaker presentations and discussion in nine biweekly sessions will tie foundational climate change adaptation concepts to key issues in the Gulf Coast region, and local case studies will offer examples of adaptation in action.

This course is a collaboration between the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), the American Society of Adaptation Professionals (ASAP), and the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA).
