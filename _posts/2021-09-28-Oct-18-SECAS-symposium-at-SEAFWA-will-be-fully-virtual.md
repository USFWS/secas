Make plans to attend the virtual SECAS symposium at the upcoming Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ (SEAFWA) annual conference, on Monday, October 18 from 1:20 - 5 pm Eastern. The symposium, **SECAS and 30 by 30: Identifying Opportunities and Defining Outcomes in the Southeast**, examines the potential of the America the Beautiful conservation initiative and the national goal to conserve 30 percent of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030. The symposium format features key conservation leaders and practitioners seeking common understanding and demonstrating complementary approaches for conservation achievement in the Southeast. A concluding session with facilitated breakouts will identify next steps and recommendations for scaling up collaboration to achieve common conservation goals through SECAS.<!--more-->
