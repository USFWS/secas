- The June web forum will feature the free, crowdsourced spatial database OpenStreetMap (OSM). OSM representatives will give an overview of the program, and SECAS staff will cover [the ways the Blueprint is using OSM data](https://secassoutheast.org/2023/05/22/Improve-the-Blueprint-by-mapping-the-places-you-know-and-love-with-OpenStreetMap.html) and provide a step-by-step training on how to edit OSM data and digitize new information so you can improve the Blueprint in the places you know and love.
