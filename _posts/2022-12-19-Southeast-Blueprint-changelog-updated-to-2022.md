The changelog for the Southeast Blueprint has been updated to include the improvements made in Blueprint 2022! In the tech world, a changelog is an easy-to-read document that captures the significant changes made in each version of a project or software program. So, every year, we update the Southeast Blueprint changelog to capture the major changes and improvements made in the latest version of the Blueprint. It serves as a helpful resource for SECAS staff, and we hope it also helps you understand what changed and why.

Since we did a major overhaul of our Blueprint approach this year, this year's changelog chapter obviously includes some significant changes. Now that we using consistent methods and data across larger swaths of the Southeast,  the changelog will become more detailed in future years as we track improvements to the modeling approach, indicators, connectivity analysis, etc.
