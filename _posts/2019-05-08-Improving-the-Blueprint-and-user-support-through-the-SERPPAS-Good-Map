Last month, Addie’s blog talked about the Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability (SERPPAS) Good Map project. The idea is for the Good Map to serve as a visual way for diverse partners to identify overlapping interests and areas for collaboration where they could get mutual benefits. Sounds familiar, right? Mallory and I have been involved in SERPPAS for awhile, but this project in particular seemed like a perfect fit for the Blueprint. Addie already mentioned that the Blueprint is being included in the Good Map, but I thought I’d follow up with some more detail on the benefits to the Blueprint and Blueprint users.

Benefit #1: More potential Blueprint users – This is the most obvious one. As a plan for shared conservation action, the more people that use the Blueprint, the more powerful it becomes.

Benefit #2: New data to improve the Blueprint – We’re always on the lookout for better data to improve the Blueprint. This is a good chance to hear about other data available that we could use to improve the indicators.

Benefit #3: Data on co-benefits for the military mission, agriculture, and renewable energy – Whether you’re a Blueprint user and working for the military, agriculture, or conservation, these new data layers can help you make a more compelling case for your actions. If you like to do things on your own, there’ll be a web portal for you to access all the data. If you’d like some help, Blueprint user support staff can help integrate this information into proposals or your organization’s priorities! Just [visit the contact page](http://secassoutheast.org/contact) and reach out to the user support lead for your state.
