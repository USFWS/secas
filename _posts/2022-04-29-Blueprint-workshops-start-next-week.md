Blueprint workshops start next week! Have you signed up yet? It's not too late! [Visit the workshop page](http://secassoutheast.org/workshops) to learn more and register. 260 people have signed up so far--and the more, the merrier!

As I explained in [my blog last month](https://secassoutheast.org/2022/03/30/register-for-a-virtual-workshop-to-review-draft-Southeast-Blueprint-2022.html), we're hosting 16 virtual workshops during the next 3 weeks to review draft Southeast Blueprint 2022 across 15 states. There's no cost to attend, and all you'll need to participate is a reliable internet connection.<!--more-->

Each one will last 1.5 hours and be hosted via Zoom. They will focus on either a group of states or a subregion. You’ll have the opportunity to provide detailed, spatially explicit feedback on the draft Blueprint by zooming into areas that you know and capturing places that are represented well, overprioritized, or underprioritized–-as well as places that you just have questions about.

The input we gather will help ensure the Blueprint represents on-the-ground conditions and captures the priorities of the broader conservation community. It also helps us as staff prioritize future improvements. As a living plan, the Blueprint is always a work in progress, so it’s great to hear firsthand from experts and Blueprint users which “known issues” are most important to fix first!

We hope you'll attend and spread the word with your colleagues!
