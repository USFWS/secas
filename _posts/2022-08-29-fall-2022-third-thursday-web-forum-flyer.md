The fall 2022 Third Thursday Web Forum flyer is now available! The September web forum will feature a project to assess dynamic patterns of floodplain inundation across the United States using Landsat imagery. The October web forum will focus on a case study demonstrating how carbon and stormwater credits, as well as equity benefits, can help drive private investment in parks and greenways. In November, Rua will summarize the improvements in the latest version of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint, which uses consistent methods and indicators Southeast-wide.

These webinars and other SECAS events are available on [the SECAS event calendar](https://secassoutheast.org/events).<!--more-->
