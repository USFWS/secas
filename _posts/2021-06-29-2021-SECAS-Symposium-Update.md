Make plans now to attend the SECAS symposium at [the upcoming SEAFWA annual conference](http://www.seafwa.org/conference/overview/) to be held October 17-20, 2021 in Roanoke, VA. The symposium is titled _SECAS and 30 X 30: Identifying Opportunities and Defining Outcomes in the Southeast_ and is intended to be the collaborative forum for examining perspectives and guiding directions related to the [“America the Beautiful”](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-outlines-america-beautiful-initiative) initiative and the 30 X 30 national goal in the Southeast. The annual conference is expected to be an in-person event with additional online options for attendees, creating the opportunity for very wide exposure. Stay tuned to the SEAFWA website for further developments.
