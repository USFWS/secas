The intersection of conservation and the military mission has emerged as a prominent theme lately in our recent work with user support. The user support team has has worked on several use cases recently where the military community has used the Blueprint to inform their conservation planning to better sustain both natural resourcse and the military mission into the future. I thought this would be a good topic for a "use case roundup" to share some examples of how the Blueprint can help in this space.

- The Middle Georgia-Robins Air Force Base Sustainability Plan is incorporating the Southeast Conservation Blueprint into their Sustainability Plan, which is a document intended to facilitate collaboration and compatible development between the Base and the surroundign communities. The Blueprin thas contributed specifically to the Environment and Cultural Resources Chapter, which uses the Blueprint to identify priority natural areas in need of conservation within a 10-mile buffer surrounding the base. This chapter of the plan also recommends using the Blueprint in a more in-ddepth follow-up study to identify priority natural areas for future protection. You can learn more about this planning effort at [https://www.robinsafbsp.com/](https://www.robinsafbsp.com/). The first public meeting is scheduled for August 5th---if you're interested in learning more about how to participate, click the "Get Involved" tab on the plan website to learn more.

 - The newly designated Northwest Florida Sentinel Landscape used the Blueprint to help define conservation focus areas within their geography, which are areas of alignment between conservation priorities and the military mission footprint. User support developed maps to strengthen the successful application to establish the Northwest Florida Sentinel Landscape. Learn more about this Sentinel Landscape on their website: [https://sentinellandscapes.org/landscapes/northwest-florida/](https://sentinellandscapes.org/landscapes/northwest-florida/). Back in 2016, the Blueprint also supported the designation of the [Eastern North Carolina Sentinel Landscape](https://sentinellandscapes.org/landscapes/eastern-north-carolina), and user support is currently assisting with the proposal for a South Carolina Lowcountry Sentinel Landscape.
 
- Last April, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Dept. of Defense, and the University of Florida released the Florida Strategic Plan for Sustaining Military Readiness through Conservation Partnerships. This plan is intended to "to ensure that the Air Force installations in Florida continue their essential military mission while contributing to landscape-scale conservation efforts in Florida." It used the Blueprint to help identify areas of overlap between military and ecological priorities that also offer the best potential protection opportunities and are threatened by development and sea-level rise. This analysis compared landscape-scale conservation priorities, specific habitat priorities for focal species, military mission priorities, threat assessment data on sea-level rise and development, and protection opportunities. Learn more about this partnership here: [https://www.fws.gov/project/partnering-us-air-force-florida](https://www.fws.gov/project/partnering-us-air-force-florida). The plan is available on request from the Panama City Ecological Service Field Office](https://www.fws.gov/office/florida-ecological-services).

- The [Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability](https://serppas.org/) (SERPPAS) incorporated the Blueprint into their "Good Map" depicting the priorities of a diverse group of partners. The good map is intended to identify areas of overlapping priorities at the intersection of protecting military readiness, conserving natural and working lands and sustaining communities, where collaboration can benefit multiple partners. You can learn more about the Good Map on the SERPPAS website: https://serppas.org/maps/](https://serppas.org/maps/). SERPPAS Coordinator Addie Thornton [blogged about this project back in 2019](https://secassoutheast.org/2019/04/15/Developing-the-Good-Map-for-the-Southeast-Regional-Partnership-for-Planning-and-Sustainability.html), as did Blueprint Coordinator Rua Mordecai [the following month](https://secassoutheast.org/2019/05/08/Improving-the-Blueprint-and-user-support-through-the-SERPPAS-Good-Map.html).
