In my work with user support, the intersection of conservation and the military mission has been a prominent theme lately. User support has worked on several use cases recently where the military community has used the Blueprint to inform their conservation planning to better sustain both natural resourcse and the military mission into the future. I thought this would be a good topic for a "use case roundup" to share some examples of how the Blueprint can help in this space.

- The Middle Georgia-Robins Air Force Base Sustainability Plan is incorporating the Southeast Conservation Blueprint into their Sustainability Plan, particularly in the Environment and Cultural Resources Chapter. The plan uses the Blueprint to identify priority natural areas within a 10-mile buffer surrounding the base that are in need of conservation. The plan also recommends using the Blueprint in a more in-ddepth follow-up study to identify priority natural areas for future protection. You can learn more about this planning effort at [https://www.robinsafbsp.com/](https://www.robinsafbsp.com/). The first public meeting is scheduled for August 5th---if you're interested in learning more about how to participate, click the "Get Involved" tab on the plan website to learn more.

 - The Northwest Florida Sentinel Landscape was successfully established earlier this year. Last year, the Northwest Florida Sentinel Landscape used the Blueprint to help define conservation focus areas within their geography, areas of alignment between conservation priorities and the military mission footprint. User support was instrumental in helping develop maps to strengthen the Sentinel Landscape application.
