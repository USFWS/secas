Are you knowledgeable or passionate about Southeast forest birds, coral and hardbottom in the Gulf of Mexico, overall patterns of landscape connectivity and fragmentation across the Southeast, or grasslands and savannas? If so, we need your help to improve several indicators in this year's update to the Southeast Conservation Blueprint--version 2024! As always, we rely on feedback from the broader SECAS community, from Blueprint users to subject matter experts to on-the-ground conservation practitioners, to drive the Blueprint development cycle. 

Four indicator review teams are now looking for expert volunteers to help provide feedback:
- Forest bird habitat
- Gulf coral and hardbottom
- Landscape condition
- Grasslands and savannas

The time committment is minimal--just a 1-hr virtual meeting! This is a fantastic way to get more involved in the Blueprint and make sure that the places you know and love are represented correctly. You'll be reviewing a draft of the indicator and providing your input on the data, methods, and approaches we're considering so far.

**Grasslands and Savannas**  
You may have already seen [the invitation to review the grasslands and savannas indicator that Emily shared](https://secassoutheast.org/2024/01/16/Calling-all-grassland-lovers-and-experts.html) in last month's newsletter. If you missed it, this indicator is intended to capture important known, potential, and historic grasslands and open tree savannas across the Southeast.

**Gulf Coral & Hardbottom**  
This indicator is meant to represent natural and artifical reefs and hardbottom habitats within the Gulf of Mexico, which are important for diverse marine life.

**Forest Bird Habitat**  
This indicator is meant to broadly capture important habitats for forest birds across the continental Southeast. It's intended to complement the existing subregional bird models developed by various Joint Venture partnerships, some of which are already incorporated into the Blueprint, to provide consistent region-wide coverage.

**Landscape Condition**
This indicator is envisioned to represent natural areas with limited human alteration while also considering the natural landcover of the surrounding landscape. The degree of naturalness across the landscape is a key ecological condition for sustaining species and ecosystem services that are sensitive to habitat fragmentation at multiple scales.
