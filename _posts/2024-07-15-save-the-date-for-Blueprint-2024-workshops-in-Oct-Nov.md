Workshops to review the latest version of the Southeast Conservation Blueprint are coming later this fall! Please save the date for the 3 weeks from Oct 22 - Nov 7. Registration links will go out in an email and the SECAS newsletter in August.

You might be thinking "hey, aren't workshops usually held in the spring?" If so, you're right--historically, they have been. That's because, in the past, we held workshops midway through the Blueprint revision cycle to get input on a draft of the latest plan. Then staff would squeeze in as many improvements as we could before finalizing and releasing the Blueprint around October.

The main benefit of having workshops to review a draft was that staff could respond to that feedback right away and fix any serious issues before launching the final Blueprint. But it had a number of drawbacks as well:

- Staff usually didn't have enough time to add corridors to the workshop draft, so folks were reviewing an incomplete Blueprint
- Because the Blueprint data was still in draft form, workshop attendees didn't have the [indicator spatial data and documentation](https://secas-fws.hub.arcgis.com/pages/blueprint) or the [Blueprint Explorer](https://blueprint.geoplatform.gov/southeast/) available to help them understand why areas were scoring a particular way
- Staff had to run the Blueprint twice in every revision cycle--once for workshops, and once for the final--which takes time that could be spent on improving the underlying indicator data

Staff always ask for feedback on how to improve workshops, and in both 2022 and 2023, we consistently heard that folks wanted the indicator data available to help inform their review. In response to that, we are moving the timing of workshops to after the final release! That will ensure everyone has access to the full suite of data and documentation to help them understand what's driving the Blueprint priorities. You'll be able to review the corridors. And staff had more time to spend on things like indicator review teams during this cycle, freeing us up to dive deeper into the underlying data and methods.

The tradeoff, of course, is that your feedback on the 2024 Blueprint won't be incorporated until the next cycle, so you won't see changes until 2025 at the earliest. However, we never had time to address all the draft Blueprint workshop comments immediately, anyway--staff were always triaging what we could fix in time for the final release and squeezing in as much as we could. A number of comments were always moved to the Blueprint "known issues" and added to the list of future improvements. And since we still intend to update annually, we hope you'll continue to find the Blueprint remains responsive to your feedback.

Overall, we're optimistic that the timing of workshops will work better for staff and attendees alike. For now, stay tuned for official workshop invitations!
