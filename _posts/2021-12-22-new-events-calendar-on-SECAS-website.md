This month, we added [a new events calendar to the SECAS website](secassoutheast.org/events). You can access it from the top menu icon labeled--perhaps unimaginatively--"events".

This lays the groundwork for shifting two recurring events under the banner of SECAS: the Third Thursday Web Forum and Triangle Climate and Conservation Coffee. Until now, these events have been hosted by the South Atlantic Blueprint team. As SECAS moves toward the more consistent 2022 Southeast Blueprint planned for Fall 2022, and away from maintaining many of the current subregional inputs, we are winding down many standalone South Atlantic Blueprint resources and transitioning the relevant ones over to SECAS. If you're interested in learning more about our plans for other South Atlantic Blueprint resources, [check out my November blog on the South Atlantic website](https://www.southatlanticlcc.org/2021/11/05/what-does-the-new-2022-southeast-blueprint-approach-mean-for-the-south-atlantic-blueprint/). We hope you'll find these changes streamline and simplify our communications.

You'll see the climate coffee and web forum posted to the new calendar each month from here on out, as well as other SECAS events, like Blueprint workshops.

For background, the Third Thursday Web Forum is a monthly webinar series that began in 2012. You've probably noticed the many blogs in the SECAS newsletter promoting many of the topics and speakers. This webinar is held every month in the same time slot, on the third Thursday of the month at 10 am Eastern time. It's intended as an opportunity to highlight exciting science in the world of landscape conservation in the region, to share the latest updates on the Blueprint and other SECAS products, and to provide partners a chance to ask questions and provide feedback to SECAS staff. If you haven't tuned in yet, I hope you'll join a web forum in the new year. We try to keep the format relaxed and interactive with lots of chances for discussion.

The Triangle Climate and Conservation Coffee event is an informal gathering of the landscape conservation and climate change community in the Raleigh, NC area. It began in 2012 and is co-hosted with the Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (SE CASC). We meet on the 1st Thursday of every month at 9 am Eastern time. Typically, we meet in person at a local coffee shop, but are temporarily meeting virtually due to COVID-19. If you're local to the Triangle area and want to receive a monthly reminder email about this event, please fill out this short Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/0XfVU1UVwF.

Keep an eye on the calendar for upcoming SECAS events, and I hope to see many of you at one of them in 2022!
