The SECAS staff team had such an exciting and thought-provoking three weeks of virtual workshops to review Draft Southeast Blueprint 2022! Thanks to the 234 people from 80 different organizations who attended and provided feedback!

Here's how attendance broke out across different sectors of the conservation community:

The primary focus of the workshop was gathering spatially explicit comments on where the Blueprint is underprioritizing, overprioritizing, or correctly prioritizing important areas for conservation. If you want to learn more about the spatial feedback provided by workshop attendees, and the fixes we're hoping to implement this year based on that input, check out Rua's blog. 

Here I'm going to focus on another element of the workshop---collecting feedback on the wording we use to communicate the Blueprint. You've probably seen this map of the current Blueprint before:

It uses the words high and medium "conservation value" to characterize the areas highlighted in the Blueprint. This wording represented a compromise across the science coordinators leading the develpopment of all the various subregional inputs to the current Southeast Blueprint.

This year, as we transition to a more consistent approach using standardized methods and data across most of the Southeast, we have an opportunity to reevaluate how we describe the various classes of the Blueprint. So, we polled a suite of Blueprint users and science communicators, in addition to Blueprint staff, to get their reactions to that phrase, "conservation value." It became immediately clear that the term "value" means very different things to different people. To some, it evoked the idea of intrinsict worth. To others, it brought to mind a an objective score or rating. Still others thought of economic value, which had negative connotations for some inviduals.





If you haven’t yet reviewed the draft Blueprint update, it’s not too late—just be aware that we won’t be able to make any changes based on your comments until next year. You can submit your feedback in this online form or just email me your thoughts at hilary_morris@fws.gov.

We’re still on track to finalize South Atlantic Blueprint 2020 by the middle of this month. We’ll post a blog here when it’s ready, so stay tuned!
