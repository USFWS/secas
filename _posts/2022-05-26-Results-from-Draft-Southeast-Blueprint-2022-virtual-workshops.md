The SECAS staff team had such an exciting and thought-provoking three weeks of virtual workshops to review Draft Southeast Blueprint 2022! Thanks to the 234 people from 80 different organizations who attended and provided feedback!

If you want to learn more about the spatial feedback provided by workshop attendees, and the fixes we're hoping to implement this year based on that input, check out Rua's blog.

In addition to asking for spatially explicit comments on where the Blueprint is underprioritizing, overprioritizing, or correctly prioritizing areas, we also gathered feedback on the wording we use to communicate the Blueprint.




If you haven’t yet reviewed the draft Blueprint update, it’s not too late—just be aware that we won’t be able to make any changes based on your comments until next year. You can submit your feedback in this online form or just email me your thoughts at hilary_morris@fws.gov.

We’re still on track to finalize South Atlantic Blueprint 2020 by the middle of this month. We’ll post a blog here when it’s ready, so stay tuned!
