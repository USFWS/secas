We've just added two new and exciting features to [the Southeast Blueprint Explorer viewer](https://secassoutheast.org/2022/12/20/the-Southeast-Blueprint-Explorer-Now-with-more-to-explore.html): filtering, and the ability to view different data layers. As a reminder, the Explorer is a simple online interface designed to make it easy to discover how a particular area is scoring in the Blueprint, and why. [Back in December, I talked about the new "pixel mode"](https://secassoutheast.org/2022/11/15/Southeast-Blueprint-Explorer-updated-with-2022-data.html) that allows you to drill into the smallest unit of the Blueprint analysis--a 30 m by 30 m square pixel--and find out what's driving the priorities.

With the addition of filtering, we've added a third button to the top toggle that says "pixel filters". If you're interested in finding the part of the Blueprint that aligns with your mission, interests, or specific question, filtering can help! _The part of the Blueprint_ is a key concept here--this is set up so that you're always looking within the Blueprint priorities.

Let's say you're particularly interested in regional connectivity--maybe you're looking for the best places to put in a new wildlife road crossing. One place to start would be to look at the parts of the Blueprint that are identified as a hub or a corridor in the underlying connectivity analysis! Now with one click, you can filter the Blueprint by the hubs and corridors.

Alternatively, maybe you're looking for the best places to restore riparian buffers. You could start by filtering the Blueprint by natural landcover in floodplains! The best candidates for restoration might be places where the amount of natural landcover has some room for improvement, where it isn't already in the best condition. So you could use the slider to select everything outside the top naturalness class. The results show the parts of the Blueprint that score in this lower range for this indicator.

If you want to mix and match filters, you can! Do you want to see those riparian buffer restoration opportunities where restoration actions would also contribute to reforestation priorities for forest breeding birds in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley? Then turn on both filters and adjust the slider to your desired range! Keep in mind that these filters are what's known as "AND" filters, meaning the results represent areas where _all_ filters apply. For example, if I were shopping for a new pair of shoes, I might want to filter my results to show only shoes that are hiking boots AND a size 8.5 AND waterproof. I'd want to see the intersection of all those variables--otherwise I'd also get results for shoes that don't meet my criteria (e.g., shoes that aren't available in my size).

The pixel filters and pixel data modes work together on the same underlying data framework, so once you've turned on filters, you'll keep that same map view once you toggle back over to pixel mode. That means you can filter to find a subset of the Blueprint, and then switch over to pixel data to drill into that portion of the map. If you have filters selected while you're in pixel data mode, an orange button at the top will remind you how many filters are currently selected. You can clear the filters using that button while in either mode. Just keep in mind that summary mode works totally differently, so when you switch over to summary mode, you'll be back to seeing the whole Blueprint map.

So, what else is new in this round of updates? We've also added a layers button at the top right of the Explorer--available in pixel data and pixel filters mode--that allows you to view other underlying datasets beyond just the Blueprint. Once you click that icon, use the eye to select other layers, like the indicators, hubs and corridors, and sea-level rise and urban growth threats. This is the first time the viewer has been able to support showing a map layer other than the Blueprint priorities, so this little button has a big impact on functionality! Be aware that you can view different layers as you filter, as well, which can add some complexity if you're filtering by one layer while looking at another. You can always go back to the Blueprint if that feels a bit overwhelming.

We've also improved the way the Explorer works with slow internet connections to make it clearer when the map is still loading.

Like everything else related to the Blueprint, the Explorer is a living product and very much a work in progress! Do you have feedback on these new features? Do you love them, find them confusing, or have ideas on how to improve them? Please reach out and let me know at hilary_morris@fws.gov. We'd love to hear from you.

We really do listen! Don't believe me? Here's a real example. A user reached out because they needed to pinpoint precise coordinates within the Explorer as part of reviewing potential offshore wind development. It's a lot harder to orient from a basemap out in the marine environment than it is on land! So we now show the lat/long of the bulls-eye in pixel mode, to make that easier for folks working offshore.

If you want to learn more, on the next Third Thursday Web Forum, I will give a live demo of the Blueprint Explorer. Please tune in to see these new features in action, and participate in what I hope will be a lively Q&A and discussion.

As always, I have to give a big shout-out to Brendan Ward of [Astute Spruce](https://astutespruce.com/), the software developer behind the Blueprint Explorer, for his amazing work.
