I'm so pleased to announce that the SECAS logo image files and associated branding guide are now available at the bottom of [the resources page](https://secassoutheast.org/resources)! This marks an important milestone for SECAS and reflects how our community and partnership have grown since our inception in 2011.  <!--more-->

The logo does a great job of representing SECAS in the full richness and complexity of our geography, our partners, and our mission. The introductory section of the logo usage guidelines says it best:

<blockquote>The SECAS logo embodies the diverse ecosystems and communities of the Southeast and U.S. Caribbean. The dogwood blossom represents the region’s rich forestry, abundant flora, and continual growth. The mountain road symbolizes the region’s iconic mountain ranges, from the Appalachians to the Sierra de Luquillo, and SECAS’ role in paving the way for a sustainable, prosperous future. The great blue heron is emblematic of interconnected terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and the harmony between land, water, and sky. The sea trout signifies the economic and cultural value of the region’s aquatic life and the importance of marine conservation. Together, these elements speak to the intricate balance between nature and society, highlighting SECAS’ commitment to fostering a future where fish, wildlife, and people thrive.</blockquote>

One thing I really like about this logo is how it echoes the look of our sister organization, the [Midwest Landscape Initiative](https://www.mlimidwest.org/), with its four quadrants representing key resources for the Midwest region. That continuity was very much intentional as we continue striving for consistency and improved integration across the [Midwest](https://mcap-fws.hub.arcgis.com/pages/midwest-conservation-blueprint) and [Southeast](https://secassoutheast.org/blueprint) Blueprints. Our goal was to nod to that shared purpose while still evoking a uniquely Southeast sense of place.

The logo is a product of SECAS staff and the broader SECAS community. All credit for the logo design and accompanying usage guidelines goes to Colleen J. Shytle, a gifted graphic artist and science communicator and passionate conservationist. She generously volunteered her time and expertise as a contribution to the partnership. Our whole staff is so grateful to her for the work she put in to understand all that SECAS is and find a way to illustrate that in a "fun sized" visual.

I also want to thank Kelly Guilbeau, Social Scientist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for her support with branding and design concepts that helped us articulate what SECAS stands for and what we wanted the logo to embody. This helped us get to a critical point in the logo development process.

I hope you'll agree that SECAS is now looking a lot more official and polished! We've come a long way from our origins as a scrappy, informal forum for the Southeast Landscape Conservation Cooperatives to coordinate their conservation planning efforts. Now we're a full-fledged organization with a formal charter, 10+ years of experience, and a dedicated staff--and a professional-looking logo to match!
