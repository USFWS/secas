The latest update to the Southeast Conservation Blueprint, version 2023, is now available in the Blueprint Explorer viewer! This easy-to-use mapping platform is designed to help you understand how your area of interest scores in the Blueprint, and why. It offers several different modes that allow you to summarize by a watershed or marine hexagon, drill into the data underlying a single point, and filter the Blueprint to narrow it down to the part you want to focus on. Now that the Explorer has caught up to Blueprint 2023, you can use these great features to discover the Blueprint priorities in new areas, like Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the offshore Gulf marine environment.

As part of this update, we changed the summary unit for marine areas from Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks to the 40 sq km hexagons used by EPA and the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (GoMMAPPS). The previous lease blocks did not go far enough into the nearshore marine environment in the Gulf of Mexico to connect with the 12-digit HUCs used for inland areas, creating an unselectable "no-man's land" just offshore. In addition, lease blocks were not available for the U.S. Caribbean marine environment. These hexagons are consistent with the scale of the GOMMAPPS data used for the [Gulf marine mammals](https://secas-fws.hub.arcgis.com/maps/fws::gulf-marine-mammals-southeast-blueprint-indicator-2023/about) and [Gulf sea turtles](https://secas-fws.hub.arcgis.com/maps/fws::gulf-sea-turtles-southeast-blueprint-indicator-2023/about) indicators, and therefore align with the Blueprint data in the Gulf marine environment.

Several other datasets have been updated as well since the last time I blogged about the Explorer. Sea-level rise projections now feature the most recent data from NOAA's Sea Level Rise Viewer. The data on current urbanization now reflects the 2021 National Land Cover Database. And, perhaps most significantly, the Explorer uses FUTURES urban growth projections developed by the NC State University Center for Geospatial Analytics. These urbananization probability layers replace the previous SLEUTH data. The FUTURES data provide a more realistic picture of the likelihood of urbanization for any given point on the landscape, and 

SECAS staff have also refined a number of features based on feedback from a recent round of user testing conducted by members of the user support team. We met with a number of key users and partners across multiple oragnizations who graciously shard their time to help improve the Explorer interface. Staff gave them a series of tasks, asked them to narrate their thought process, and observed where the testers found things easy or difficult to do. By identifying "pain points" where folks tend to get stuck, as well as the workflows that made intuitive sense, we identified several opportunities to improve the Explorer functionality.

You'll see new wording on the buttons for each mode, along with tooltips when you mouse over the button, to better clarify what each mode does.

The location search has moved from the introductory sidebar to the upper right of the map. This ensures the location search is accessible from all modes, and is a more intuitive place to find a feature that controls the map view. We also improved the search widget so it covers a more comprehensive range of locations. You can search by place names, addresses, and even coordinates (latitutde/longitude)!

We also moved out of the sidebar instructions on how to use the viewer. Those are now available from the top menu. We expanded the level of detail available in those instructions, and added screenshots. This makes the sidebar text shorter and easier to read, and provides a better step-by-step tutorial for those folks who like to read the directions before they try to assemble IKEA furniture--or use an online viewer. ;)
