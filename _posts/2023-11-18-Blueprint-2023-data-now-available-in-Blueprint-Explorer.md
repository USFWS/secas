The latest update to the Southeast Conservation Blueprint, version 2023, is now available in the Blueprint Explorer viewer! This easy-to-use mapping platform is designed to help you understand how your area of interest scores in the Blueprint, and why. It offers several different modes that allow you to summarize by a watershed or marine hexagon, drill into the data underlying a single point, and filter the Blueprint to narrow it down to the part you want to focus on. Now that the Explorer has caught up to Blueprint 2023, you can use these great features to discover the Blueprint priorities in new areas, like Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the offshore Gulf marine environment.

As part of this update, we changed the summary unit for marine areas from Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks to the 40 sq km hexagons used by EPA and the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (GoMMAPPS). The previous lease blocks did not go far enough into the nearshore marine environment in the Gulf of Mexico to connect with the 12-digit HUCs used for inland areas, creating an unselectable "no-man's land" just offshore. In addition, lease blocks were not available for the U.S. Caribbean marine environment. These hexagons are consistent with the scale of the GOMMAPPS data used for the Gulf marine mammals and Gulf sea turtles indicators, and therefore align with the Blueprint data in the Gulf marine area.

SECAS staff have also refined a number of features based on feedback from a recent round of user testing conducted by members of the user support team. We met with a number of key users and partners across multiple oragnizations who graciously shard their time to help improve the Explorer interface. Staff gave them a series of tasks, asked them to narrate their thought process, and observed where the testers found things easy or difficult to do. By identifying "pain points" where folks tend to get stuck, as well as the workflows that made intuitive sense, we identified several opportunities to improve the Explorer functionality.

We updated the wording on the buttons for each mode and added tooltips to better clarify what you can do in each mode.
