Mark your calendars – there will be a special symposium on the Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS) at this year’s Annual Conference of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA).

This symposium will present recent progress and identify important next steps for key elements of this shared conservation adaptation strategy, including network of landscapes and seascapes, conservation collaboration, and landscape change information.<!--more-->

The SECAS symposium will be held from 8 am until noon on November 4, 2015; the SEAFWA conference runs November 1 through November 4 in Asheville, North Carolina. Immediately following and building on the SECAS symposium is a stakeholder engagement workshop: _Realizing the Vision for Fish and Wildlife in a Changing Southeast._
