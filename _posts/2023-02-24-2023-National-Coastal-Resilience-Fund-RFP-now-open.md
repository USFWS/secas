The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) has released its [request for pre-proposals for the 2023 National Coastal Resilience Fund](https://www.nfwf.org/programs/national-coastal-resilience-fund/national-coastal-resilience-fund-2023-request-proposals). Pre-proposals are due on Wednesday, April 12, 2023.

According to the RFP, "NFWF will award up to $140 million in grants to create and restore natural systems in order to increase protection for communities from coastal hazards, such as storms, sea- and lake-level changes, inundation, and coastal erosion, while improving habitats for fish and wildlife species. NFWF prioritizes projects that are community led or incorporate direct community engagement and benefit underserved communities facing disproportionate harm from climate impacts."<!--more-->

This year, the RFP focuses on four project categories:

- Community Capacity Building and Planning
- Site Assessment and Preliminary Design
- Final Design and Permitting
- Restoration Implementation

An informational webinar on Thursday, March 2, 2023 from 3:00-4:30pm ET will provide an overview of this funding opportunity. NFWF strongly encourages applicants to participate. You can register for the webinar here: [https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/7450291218725880410](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/7450291218725880410)

Are you thinking of applying? Your Southeast Blueprint user support staff would love to help you tell a compelling story about how your project would contribute to a regional goal and vision. We can analyze data, make maps, and write narratives that help meet the priorities of the RFP around nature-based solutions, community resilience benefits, and fish and wildlife benefits. Would you like to look at:

- How your project area scores in the Southeast Conservation Blueprint?
- How your proposed actions would contribute to wildlife corridors and regional connectivity?
- How your area of interest is likely to be impacted by sea-level rise?
- How your project would advance the SECAS goal?
- Where coastal marshes are predicted to be most resilient to the impacts of sea-level rise?
- Where new open space access opportunities would make the biggest impact for socially vulnerable communities?
- Where restoring natural floodplains would produce the biggest natural and cultural resource co-benefits?

User support can help by contributing to your proposal, writing a letter of support, or just brainstorming creative ways to connect local actions to regional impacts. You can find our contact information [on the SECAS staff page](https://secassoutheast.org/staff).
