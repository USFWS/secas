The team that develops the South Atlantic Blueprint is partnering with the wonderful folks at the [Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center (CASC)](https://secasc.ncsu.edu/) to put on a great webinar series this April through July! Each webinar will highlight a Southeast CASC project that applies to landscape-scale conservation in the Southeast. These webinars will take place in the usual South Atlantic Third Thursday Web Forum Series time slot, on the third Thursday of every month at 10 am Eastern time. 

So in light of that, guess what we're calling it? Can I get a drumroll, please? I want you to imagine this in your favorite dramatic narrator voice.

**The Southeast CASC & South Atlantic Spring/Summer Science Series** 

How's that for alliteration?

I'm sort of kidding, but sort of not, becuase as you can see, it's on the flyer. Maybe all this social distancing is making us a bit loopy.

[This page on the Southeast CASC's website](https://secasc.ncsu.edu/s6series/) has all the information about the series and how to register!
