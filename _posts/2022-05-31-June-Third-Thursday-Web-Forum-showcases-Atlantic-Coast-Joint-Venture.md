The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture (ACJV) is a regional partnership that collaborates to restore and sustain native bird populations and habitats throughout the ACJV region. The ACJV is comprised of 16 state wildlife agencies from Maine to Florida and the territory of Puerto Rico; federal and regional habitat conservation agencies; and other organizations that share our vision. The partnership is currently focused on one of the most imperiled habitats in the ACJV region – coastal marshes and the suite of vulnerable birds that depend on them. The ACJV is leading a coordinated marsh restoration and protection effort across the flyway to ensure that the partnership can achieve its vision.

The ACJV has worked to create science products and initiatives to fuel this coordinated effort. In this webinar we will review the current regional science efforts underway for the ACJV flagship species – the Saltmarsh Sparrow, eastern Black Rail, and American Black Duck.
