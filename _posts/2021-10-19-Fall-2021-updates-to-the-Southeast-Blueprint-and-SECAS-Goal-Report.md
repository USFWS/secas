Fall is upon us, and that means it’s time for an update to the core products of the Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS)! We’ve already released the [2021 SECAS Goal Report](http://secassoutheast.org/pdf/SECAS-goal-report-2021.pdf), which uses the most recent 3-6 years of data from existing monitoring programs to tracks progress toward the [SECAS Goal](http://secassoutheast.org/our-goal): a 10% or greater improvement in the health, function, and connectivity of Southeastern ecosystems by 2060. A 2021 update to the Southeast Conservation Blueprint is coming soon, and will incorporate the latest priorities from the 2021 South Atlantic Blueprint.<!--more-->

In this webinar, Rua will provide an overview of what’s new in this year’s Goal Report and Blueprint. He’ll also discuss key takeaways from the SECAS symposium at this year’s SEAFWA annual meeting, which examined the role of SECAS in the America the Beautiful initiative and goal to conserve 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030.

A recording will be posted afterwards [to the calendar event on the South Atlantic website](https://www.southatlanticlcc.org/event/third-thursday-web-forum-fall-2021-updates-to-the-southeast-blueprint-and-secas-goal-report/), if you’re unable to attend.

We'll skip the December web forum for the holidays, so this webinar will conclude the series for 2021.
