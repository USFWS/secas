7/14/2017 7:37:06,"Higher seas to flood dozens of US cities, study says; is yours one of them?",7/12/2017,Jennifer Gray,CNN,"For the past several years, scientists have been trying to get people to wake up to the dangers that lie ahead in rising seas due to climate change. A comprehensive list now names hundreds of US cities, large and small, that may not make it through the next 20, 50 or 80 years due to sea level rise.

Featuring places like New York, Boston, San Francisco and Miami, the list paints a grim picture of what our nation could look like if sea level predictions are accurate.",http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/12/us/weather-cities-inundated-climate-change/index.html,,wylie_carr@fws.gov

A study released Wednesday from the Union of Concerned Scientists highlights the potential impacts of sea level rise by the end of the century on hundreds of US cities, using three different emissions scenarios to determine the range of damage. Under the UCS analysis, cities like Boston, New York, San Francisco and Miami could face serious impacts from sea level rise by 2100.",http://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/when-rising-seas-hit-home-chronic-inundation-from-sea-level-rise#.WWirhPnyuUm,,wylie_carr@fws.gov
7/24/2017 17:02:28,Taking Wetland Science on a Road Trip,6/9/2017,Jessica Blackband,South Central Climate Science Center,"Putting science on the ground sometimes means hitting the road. In early June, Sinead Borchert, a USGS ecologist funded by the South Central and Southeast CSCs, set off on a tour of the Gulf of Mexico coast. Wetlands in this region are on the move in response to sea-level rise and land use change, presenting a serious challenge for managers. Borchert’s mission was to share LCC-funded research on how wetlands are expected to move over time and to explore possibilities for the use of this research in local conservation decision-making.",http://www.southcentralclimate.org/index.php/pages/news/557,,jblackband@ou.edu
8/11/2017 16:12:23,"The Sea Level Did, in Fact, Rise Faster in the Southeast U.S.",8/9/2017,Justin Gillis,The New York Times,"Sea Level Rises Sharper on Southeast Coast: Sea levels along the coast of the Southeastern US rose at a rate of six times more than the global average between 2011 and 2015, according to new research. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, University of Florida researchers explain that two large-scale atmospheric patterns collided to create a ""hot spot"" of sea level rise off the Southeast Coast, causing water to pile up and inundate coastal areas. This hot spot could be linked to the increasingly severe flooding experienced by Southeastern states over the past few years, and may also help scientists more accurately predict tidal flooding. Researchers warn that while the hot spot may move and cause flooding in the area to slow temporarily, communities on the coast must still prepare for longer-term sea level rise.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/climate/the-sea-level-did-in-fact-rise-faster-in-the-southeast-us.html,,wylie_carr@fws.gov

But, we do. 

Both of us served as the Department of Agriculture's under secretary of agriculture for natural resources and environment — one for President George W. Bush and one for Barack Obama. In that role, we both witnessed the dramatic increase in severe wildfires in the nation’s forests and grasslands.

8/23/2017 7:15:33,"Warmer waters mean more driving, less fishing",8/21/2017,USGS,,"For millions of years, the eastern brook trout thrived in the valleys of the Appalachian Mountains. The East Coast’s only native trout, it was a staple of Native American diets and for some tribes considered a gift from spiritual leaders. It has also been a prized species among anglers since early colonial times. Yet changes in the landscape have impacted water quality and led to a reduction in suitable brook trout habitat. The species has disappeared from 28% of its native range, and warming temperatures are expected to further reduce the cold-water habitat that the brook trout relies on.
