This comprehensive report evaluates the effects of climate change, sea level rise, and urbanization on four Gulf Coast ecosystems and 11 species that depend on them. The ecosystems covered in the assessment include mangrove, oyster reef, tidal emergent marsh and barrier islands. The species are roseate spoonbill, blue crab, clapper rail, mottled duck, spotted seatrout, eastern oyster, American oystercatcher, red drum, black skimmer, Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, and Wilson’s plover.</p> \n\n<p>Of the species assessed, Kemp’s ridley sea turtle is thought to be the most vulnerable species as a result of nesting habitat loss to sea level rise, erosion, and urbanization. Tidal emergent marsh is considered to be the most vulnerable ecosystem due in part to sea level rise and erosion. In general, avian species were more vulnerable than fish because of the exposure and sensitivity of their nesting habitat loss to sea level rise, erosion, and potential increases in storm surge. </p>\n\n<p>Given the potential vulnerabilities of these species and habitats, additional research focus has been placed on them to reduce uncertainties associated with their responses to threats of sea level rise, urbanization, and other land use change. Further, the apparent resilience of some species and habitats to these same stressors has provided greater confidence to managers implementing restoration projects targeting these species and habitats. Additional work is ongoing to further refine the GCVA to improve and expand its utility in decision-making.</p>\n","photo":"gcp-lcc-coarse-filter-lcd.jpg","caption":"Kemp's Ridley sea turtle - a species vulnerable to sea level rise.

This priority map will guide TNC’s conservation efforts and inform the work of partners, like local land trusts, statewide. They filtered down the Blueprint to identify the hubs, corridors, and buffers and restoration areas that align with their mission. TNC has already used that updated vision to support the successful reauthorization of the SC Conservation Bank. In particular, the Blueprint helped communicate to the state legislature that the conservation community has come together around a shared set of priorities and implemented projects strategically. It also illustrated how using a data-driven conservation plan can ensure funding is targeted in a rigorous way.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is exploring using the Blueprint as the basis for their next State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP) focus areas map.

The project supported prescribed burning in priority longleaf pine focus areas across the South Atlantic and helped break prescribed fire records in the region!

The decline of the salamander is a local symptom of the broader decline in longleaf pine communities across the Southeast. The area around St. Marks is a high priority in the Blueprint and scores highly in the South Atlantic pine and prairie amphibians indicator.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Wildland Fire Resilient Landscapes funding supported by the Blueprint went toward growing season burns at St. Marks. Growing season burns are critical for maintaining frosted flatwoods salamander habitat because the species relies on ephemeral wetlands that can be overtaken by woody vegetation in the absence of fire, and breeding occurs in the dormant season. Short-term monitoring suggested refuge salamander populations responded positively to those burns.</p>\n","photo":"frosted-flatwoods-salamander-st-marks-alan-cressler.jpg","caption":"Frosted flatwoods salamander in advanced larval stage at St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in Florida.
