This comprehensive report evaluates the effects of climate change, sea level rise, and urbanization on four Gulf Coast ecosystems and 11 species that depend on them. The ecosystems covered in the assessment include mangrove, oyster reef, tidal emergent marsh and barrier islands. The species are roseate spoonbill, blue crab, clapper rail, mottled duck, spotted seatrout, eastern oyster, American oystercatcher, red drum, black skimmer, Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, and Wilson’s plover.</p> \n\n<p>Of the species assessed, Kemp’s ridley sea turtle is thought to be the most vulnerable species as a result of nesting habitat loss to sea level rise, erosion, and urbanization. Tidal emergent marsh is considered to be the most vulnerable ecosystem due in part to sea level rise and erosion. In general, avian species were more vulnerable than fish because of the exposure and sensitivity of their nesting habitat loss to sea level rise, erosion, and potential increases in storm surge. </p>\n\n<p>Given the potential vulnerabilities of these species and habitats, additional research focus has been placed on them to reduce uncertainties associated with their responses to threats of sea level rise, urbanization, and other land use change. Further, the apparent resilience of some species and habitats to these same stressors has provided greater confidence to managers implementing restoration projects targeting these species and habitats. Additional work is ongoing to further refine the GCVA to improve and expand its utility in decision-making.</p>\n","photo":"gcp-lcc-coarse-filter-lcd.jpg","caption":"Kemp's Ridley sea turtle - a species vulnerable to sea level rise.

Longleaf pine forests, with towering trees and open, grassy understories, once spanned 90 million acres from Virginia to Texas. Fire suppression, deforestation, and land-use changes reduced it to only 3% of its former range by the late 1990s. Thanks in part to <a href=\"https://longleafalliance.org/\">The Longleaf Alliance</a> and <a href=\"http://americaslongleaf.org/\">America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative</a>, the longleaf pine forest is now on its way back to prominence. Seventeen LITs are currently working throughout nine states to manage existing longleaf forests and implement restoration projects. The teams are made up of government agencies, conservation organizations, industry, and private landowners, all sharing resources, ideas and best practices. LITs are drafting conservation plans, identifying collective goals and developing landscape-scale maps to help assess, visualize and track collective longleaf restoration priorities. America’s Longleaf and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation are encouraging LITs to share these priorities in a <a href=\"https://storymap.longleafalliance.org/roadmap-to-restore-longleaf-pine/\">“Longleaf Restoration Road Map”</a> to improve range-wide communication and planning.</p> \n\n<p>The Longleaf Alliance has been working closely with LITs and the larger conservation community to collect relevant spatial data, facilitate discussions, and develop priority maps. The Blueprint proved instrumental in identifying potential high-quality habitat areas for open pine systems outside of partner lands. It also supported data compatibility across the range. In particular, three LITs have applied the Blueprint as a key element in their mapping process so far:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Chattahoochee Fall Line Conservation Partnership (GA and AL)</li>\n<li>SoLo-ACE Longleaf Partnership (SC)</li>\n<li>DeSoto/Camp-Shelby Local Implementation Team (MS and AL)</li></ul>\n\n<p>These projects used the Blueprint to help map strategic restoration targets to achieve tangible conservation outcomes and support range-wide conservation planning efforts for longleaf.

Given sufficient time and space, these wetlands can migrate inland in response to sea-level rise. In support of SECAS, and to better integrate coastal adaptation efforts across the Gulf, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a dataset predicting where inland migration of tidal saline wetlands is expected to occur under different sea-level rise and urbanization scenarios. It identifies where migration is possible due to the absence of barriers, as well as where it’s not due to urban growth and levees. The data is intended to inform the conservation of coastal landscapes as well as help sustain the ecosystem goods and services they provide, such as buffering storm impacts and providing nursery habitat for commercial fisheries.

This effort, also supported in part by staff and funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Science Applications program, furthered TNC’s work to increase the use of natural infrastructure in the Gulf region. TNC and USGS hosted a series of workshops in the summer of 2017 to help local governments, land trusts and resource managers identify opportunities to protect open space and wetland migration corridors through land acquisition, land use planning, and the National Flood Insurance Program’s Community Rating System. Representatives from 41 cities and 26 counties and parishes attended to better understand how to use the wetland migration projections and sea-level rise information in their decision-making. After the workshops, TNC and USGS provided custom data products to 68 attendees who requested additional data and maps.</p> \n\n<p>In Charlotte Harbor, the workshop led to discussions about a mangrove restoration project, in    the form of a living shoreline, along a seawall in front of a Sheraton Hotel. The hotel is a partner in the planning process and helped fund a mangrove shoreline design in partnership with the City of Punta Gorda, TNC, and the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program.
