In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, University of Florida researchers explain that two large-scale atmospheric patterns collided to create a \"hot spot\" of sea level rise off the Southeast Coast, causing water to pile up and inundate coastal areas. This hot spot could be linked to the increasingly severe flooding experienced by Southeastern states over the past few years, and may also help scientists more accurately predict tidal flooding. Researchers warn that while the hot spot may move and cause flooding in the area to slow temporarily, communities on the coast must still prepare for longer-term sea level rise.","URL of full story":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/climate/the-sea-level-did-in-fact-rise-faster-in-the-southeast-us.html","(url to) Photo":"","Email Address":"wylie_carr@fws.gov"},{"Timestamp":"8/14/2017 9:29:46","Story Title":"We worked for Bush & Obama: Here's a bipartisan solution to America's wildfire problem","Story Date":"8/11/2017","Story Author":"Robert Bonnie, Mark Rey, Opinion contributors","Author's Organization":"Former Department of Agriculture Under Secretaries","Story Teaser":"Republicans and Democrats aren’t supposed to agree on much these days, particularly when it comes to the environment and management of our public lands.

And while these challenges can sometimes feel insurmountable, we also recognize that there are things we can do – partnerships we can forge, actions we can take, and policies we can implement – to help protect and restore wild places. Most recently, E.O. Wilson called for the conservation of half the world’s land and sea in order to save 85% of biodiversity. He describes this vision in his 2016 book Half-Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life. While Wilson’s theory wasn’t a new concept for those working in conservation, it was the call to action we needed to implement theory on the ground. \n\nThrough the Eastern Wildway Network, an initiative of Wildlands Network, we seek to map out and implement this call to action in eastern North America. For the past year and a half, we have spent painstaking hours tracking down and evaluating datasets, meeting with conservation leaders, and crafting a visionary map of what Half-Earth would look like in the East.
