In early June, Sinead Borchert, a USGS ecologist funded by the South Central and Southeast CSCs, set off on a tour of the Gulf of Mexico coast. Wetlands in this region are on the move in response to sea-level rise and land use change, presenting a serious challenge for managers. Borchert’s mission was to share LCC-funded research on how wetlands are expected to move over time and to explore possibilities for the use of this research in local conservation decision-making.","url":"http://www.southcentralclimate.org/index.php/pages/news/557","photoUrl":"","email":"jblackband@ou.edu"},{"timestamp":"8/11/2017 16:12:23","title":"The Sea Level Did, in Fact, Rise Faster in the Southeast U.S.","date":"8/9/2017","author":"Justin Gillis","organization":"The New York Times","teaser":"Sea Level Rises Sharper on Southeast Coast: Sea levels along the coast of the Southeastern US rose at a rate of six times more than the global average between 2011 and 2015, according to new research. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, University of Florida researchers explain that two large-scale atmospheric patterns collided to create a \"hot spot\" of sea level rise off the Southeast Coast, causing water to pile up and inundate coastal areas. This hot spot could be linked to the increasingly severe flooding experienced by Southeastern states over the past few years, and may also help scientists more accurately predict tidal flooding. Researchers warn that while the hot spot may move and cause flooding in the area to slow temporarily, communities on the coast must still prepare for longer-term sea level rise.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/climate/the-sea-level-did-in-fact-rise-faster-in-the-southeast-us.html","photoUrl":"","email":"wylie_carr@fws.gov"},{"timestamp":"8/14/2017 9:29:46","title":"We worked for Bush & Obama: Here's a bipartisan solution to America's wildfire problem","date":"8/11/2017","author":"Robert Bonnie, Mark Rey, Opinion contributors","organization":"Former Department of Agriculture Under Secretaries","teaser":"Republicans and Democrats aren’t supposed to agree on much these days, particularly when it comes to the environment and management of our public lands.

The East Coast’s only native trout, it was a staple of Native American diets and for some tribes considered a gift from spiritual leaders. It has also been a prized species among anglers since early colonial times. Yet changes in the landscape have impacted water quality and led to a reduction in suitable brook trout habitat. The species has disappeared from 28% of its native range, and warming temperatures are expected to further reduce the cold-water habitat that the brook trout relies on.
