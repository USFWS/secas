## How do individuals/organizations apply the strategy to their own work?

The SECAS Blueprint can provide individuals and organizations - from natural resource agencies to city planners to industry - regional context for local decisions. It can also help to find common ground with others in aligning efforts to protect fish and wildlife habitat, improve quality of life for people, and develop strong economies. Examples of questions the SECAS Blueprint can support answering include:
- Where are the best places for smart urban growth that minimize negative impacts to fish and wildlife and provide greater access to open space?
- How do proposed new public lands fit into a connected network of lands and waters across the region?
- Where would stream restoration provide the most benefits to fish, human health, and outdoor recreation?
- Where should we focus conservation efforts now to improve the resilience of ecosystems and communities in advance of major disasters like hurricanes and oil spills?
- Where will economic incentives achieve the most conservation benefits on working lands?
