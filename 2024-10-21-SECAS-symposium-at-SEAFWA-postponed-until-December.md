Anyone who was registered for the [2024 SEAFWA annual conference](https://seafwa.org/conference/2024) has probably heard that it was postponed to December 9-13 due to impacts from Hurricane Helene in the Augusta, GA area and across the broader Southeast region.

Of course, this also means that the SECAS symposium has been postponed. The new date will be Wednesday, December 11th, still from 1:20-5:00 pm. For a refresher course on what the symposium will cover, [check out this blog from August](https://secassoutheast.org/2024/08/23/SECAS-Symposium-Building-the-Southeast-Landscape-of-the-Future-Together.html) written by Mallory and Amanda, two former SECAS Coordinators. In a nutshell, this year's symposium will continue conversations from the Southeast Landscape of the Future Summit held in New Orleans, LA back in February. The full schedule and details are available on the schedule tab of [the conference website](https://seafwa.org/conference/2024).

Hope to see you there!
