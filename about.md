## Who We Are

SECAS is a regional conservation initiative that spans the Southeastern United States and Caribbean. SECAS was started in 2011 by the states of the Southeastern Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies and the federal agencies of the Southeast Natural Resource Leaders Group (<a href="http://secassoutheast.org/2019/07/22/a-brief-history-of-SECAS.html">for more information on the history of SECAS, read this blog</a>). SECAS emerged as a response to the unprecedented challenges facing our natural and cultural resources, like urban growth and climate change. We see these challenges as an opportunity to coordinate conservation action and investment around a shared strategy.

#What We Do

SECAS brings together state and federal agencies, nonprofit organizations, partnershps, tribes, private businsses, and universities around a shared vision of the future. We're working to design and achieve a connected network of lands and waters to benefit, ecosystems, species, and people.

SECAS tracks regional metrics of ecosystem health, function, and connectivity to report annually on progress toward achieving the SECAS 10% goal.

SECAS develops <a href="../blueprint">the Southeast Conservation Blueprint</a>, a living, spatial plan that identifies the most important areas for conservation and restoration across the region. It stitches together smaller subregional plans into one unifying map---a spatial action plan for achieving the SECAS vision and goal. More than 150 people from over 70 organizations have used or are using the Blueprint in their work. <a href="../story-map">Visit the SECAS in Action story map</a> to explore in-depth examples of how the Blueprint is making a differece on the ground.

## The Need for SECAS

The dramatic changes sweeping the Southeastern United States pose unprecedented challenges for sustaining our natural and cultural resources:

- More than 89 million people call the Southeastern United States home. The region’s population has grown roughly 40% faster than any other part of the country over the past six decades.
- If current trends continue, research predicts that urban areas in the Southeast may double in size by 2060, creating a mega-city connecting Raleigh to Atlanta.
- This rapid growth comes at the expense of fish and wildlife habitat, working lands, and the rural character of our region. By the year 2060, studies predict a loss of forest lands equal to the size of South Carolina (23 million acres).
- Sea-level rise is also contributing to coastal land loss, taking away marshes that provide nature’s best storm protection and threatening the Gulf Coast economy, which is highly intertwined with its natural resource base and provides 1/3 of the nation’s seafood.

These changes affect not only our natural world, but also our quality of life and economic well-being. We rely on healthy ecosystems and the benefits they provide society, including clean and plentiful drinking water, outdoor recreation opportunities, protection of life and property, and other resources critical to industry. Wildlife- and fish-dependent recreation alone generates an estimated \$20 billion in economic activity annually in the Southeast.

These challenges are too big for any one organization to overcome alone, but they offer a clear opportunity to rally around a shared plan. Through SECAS, conservation partners from every sector are making a collective impact to sustain our natural and cultural resources into a changing future.
