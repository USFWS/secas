## Introduction to SECAS

The dramatic changes sweeping the Southeastern United States—such as urbanization, competition for water resources, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and climate change—pose unprecedented challenges for sustaining our natural and cultural resources. However, they also offer a clear opportunity to unite the conservation community around a shared, long- term vision for the future. The Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS) is that vision. Through SECAS, diverse partners are working together to design and achieve a connected network of lands and waters that supports thriving fish and wildlife populations and improved quality of life for people across the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. Together, federal, state, nonprofit and private organizations are coordinating their conservation actions and investments to focus on common goals.

SECAS was initiated by states of the Southeastern Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies and the federal Southeast Natural Resource Leaders Group (<a href="http://secassoutheast.org/2019/07/22/a-brief-history-of-SECAS.html">for more information on the history of SECAS, read this blog</a>). The primary product of SECAS is the Southeast Conservation Blueprint. The Blueprint stitches together smaller subregional plans into one unifying map that identifies important areas for conservation and restoration &mdash; a living spatial plan to make the SECAS vision a reality. More than 130 people from over 50 organizations have used or are using the Blueprint in their work. [Learn more about the latest version of the Blueprint]({{ "/blueprint" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

## The Need for SECAS

- More than 89 million people call the Southeastern United States home. The region’s population has grown roughly 40% faster than any other part of the country over the past six decades.
- If current trends continue, research predicts that urban areas in the Southeast may double in size by 2060, creating a mega-city connecting Raleigh to Atlanta.
- This rapid growth comes at the expense of fish and wildlife habitat, working lands, and the rural character of our region. By the year 2060, studies predict a loss of forest lands equal to the size of South Carolina (23 million acres).
- Sea-level rise is also contributing to coastal land loss, taking away marshes that provide nature’s best storm protection and threatening the Gulf Coast economy, which is highly intertwined with its natural resource base and provides 1/3 of the nation’s seafood.

These changes affect not only our natural world, but also our quality of life and economic well-being. We rely on healthy ecosystems and the benefits they provide society, including clean and plentiful drinking water, outdoor recreation opportunities, protection of life and property, and other resources critical to industry. Wildlife- and fish-dependent recreation alone generates an estimated \$20 billion in economic activity annually in the Southeast.
