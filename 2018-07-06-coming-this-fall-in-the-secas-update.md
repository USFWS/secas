Here are a few of the updates and new resources planned for the fall Southeast Conservation Adaptation Strategy (SECAS) update:

1. Update of the Texas part of the Blueprint using new information from the Texas Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool (CHAT). With this update, the Blueprint will provide seamless coverage over most of the United States.
2. Integrated threat layers covering the full Southeast.
3. Integrated hubs and corridors layer covering Peninsular Florida, South Atlantic, North Atlantic, Appalachians, and possibly the Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks.

Iâ€™ll be talking about these updates and more on the August South Atlantic Third Thursday Web Forum.
