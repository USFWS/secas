## The Southeast Conservation Blueprint

The Southeast Conservation Blueprint is a living, spatial plan that identifies priority areas for a connected network of lands and waters.

## Supporting Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA) states and territories

### Regional Species of Greatest Conservation Need

The Southeast Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ Wildlife Diversity Committee has developed a list of “Regional Species of Greatest Conservation Need” (RSGCN) that highlights the region’s extraordinary biodiversity and endemism and identifies priority species for cross-state cooperation.

## The 2020 SECAS Futures Project

The 2020 SECAS Futures Project was a year-long effort to examine how SECAS is adding value to partner organizations and sustaining progress toward meeting its vision and goal. The final report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the partnership.

## SECAS Statement of Shared Purpose

The SECAS Statement of Shared Purpose was approved by the Steering Committee in May 2021. As one of the recommendations of the Futures Project, the statement was collaboratively developed among the SECAS Points of Contact, SECAS staff, Steering Committee, and other partnership representatives to improve coordination and communication about SECAS while providing greater detail on the vision, structure, function and organization of the initiative.
